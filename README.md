# dim-wish-list-splitter

I'm no longer manually updating this project. However, it checks for an update everyday at midnight so it will be kept up to date as long as there aren't any format changes to the voltron source. 

----------------------------------------------------------------

Uses the voltron.txt file from dim-wish-list-sources by 48klocs (https://github.com/48klocs/dim-wish-list-sources).

Separates PvE, PvP, Controller, MKB, and their combinations into seperate files.

If no PvP or PvE tag weapon added to only PvE. If no MKB or Controller tag weapon added to MKB.

To add to DIM:
1. Go into "wishlist" folder
2. Select a txt file
3. Go to raw version. Either click "view raw" link or button on top right side of text window.
4. Copy URL of raw version
5. On DIM, navigate to Settings-Wish Lists
6. Paste under "Optionally, supply the URL(s) for a wish list (pipe | separated)"
7. Click "Update Wish List Source"

To Change WishLists Either:
* Copy new URL of raw verion of a wishlist
* Adjust ending of existing URL (ex. .../wishlists/MKB.txt --> .../wishlists/MKB_PVE.txt)
