# dim-wish-list-splitter

I'm no longer manually updating this project. However, it checks for an update everyday at midnight so it will be kept up to date as long as there aren't any format changes to the voltron source. 

Special thanks to CryoRenegade (https://github.com/CryoRenegade) for making me aware of GitHub workflows.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Uses the voltron.txt file from dim-wish-list-sources by 48klocs (https://github.com/48klocs/dim-wish-list-sources).

Splits Voltron into separate lists using a variety of filters such as:
- Gamemode: PVE, PVP
- Input: Mouse and Keyboard (MKB), Controller (CTR)
- Author: Currently only Pandapaxxy (Panda)
- Dupes: Number of time same roll is recommended. Currently only using D2, or rolls with at least 2 dupes
- Perks: Limits rolls to specific perk columns. Currently Perks only limits to 3rd and 4th column.

Feel free to submit an issue if you'd like to see a wish list added.

If no PvP or PvE tag weapon added to only PvE. If no MKB or Controller tag weapon added to MKB.
