But the charge time increase really hurt their overall utility. The change to 5 bolts was nice, but not having high-impact reserves in this weapons perk pool is a bit of a let down.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "High-impact frame autos feel weird. They shoot too slow for my liking but their damage is incredible. They can chew through rank-and-file enemies with ease, but their low magazine size handicaps them. The best thing to do is try and work around the low magazine by bumping it up or bypassing it entirely. Doing both with appended mag and demolitionist might give you the best bang for your buck. Add on adrenaline junkie for the damage boost and you have a pretty solid weapon. Osmosis will help with elemental wells and general subclass synergy. Cascade point and target lock are interesting.

// Wilderflight
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Wilderflight is an incredibly unique weapon. Similar to Warden’s Law it fires two grenades at once. This does mean that the grenades can split off and you’d only be doing half damage. The double grenades do have two impact damages which does put them ahead of regular grenade launchers. Auto-loading holster is still the best for fire-and-forget. Disruption break is always going to be a strong pick, especially on impacts for demolishing shields. Frenzy and vorpal can work if you’re primarily going to be using Wilderflight as your main source of damage instead of setting up yourself or your team for kinetic damage."

// Wilderflight
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "I don’t know how to feel about Wilderflight in PvP. Technically you can do more damage with double impact, and have some forgiveness with proximity grenades. But it also means that the architecture can really mess you up if you go to bounce shot and it splits the grenades into two different directions. I have yet to fully test out the full damage of each grenade, but disruption break will still probably be then play. Being able to hit one grenade and break a shield will give your kinetic 50% more damage which will definitely drop any guardian with ease." Recommended MW - Blast Radius.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Fire and Forget
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Other than Disparity, this is probably the best weapon to grind for this season. [...] Fire and Forget also being stasis allows you to go big damage with Silence and Squall and font of might. The aggressive burst linear fusions are definitely best in slot. Fire and Forget is an incredible gift from the Bungie gods. I would highly recommend bringing the recoil direction up to 100 with arrowhead brake. That way you can solely focus on fighting flinch. You can go a couple different routes with magazine and masterwork, but I prefer mag dumping and better burst dps with accelerated coils and charge time MW. Field prep is best for pure damage, but headstone and vorpal are probably what I will be going for. That way I can have some decent damage and crowd control. Chill clip is interesting and certainly viable, but I don’t know how useful it will really be in practice." Recommended MW - Charge Time.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Having 14 zoom makes it firmly middle of the pack and having the lowest base range in its class (technically Escape Velocity is lower, but Escape Velocity also gets sights, not barrels) doesn’t help it. What it lacks in range it does make up for in stability, being on the upper percentile. It also has some of the best aim assist for its archetype. Rangefinder is definitely a must, as is pushing up the range. Hammer-forged rifling or smallbore is going to be key, but don’t decrease other stats just to increase your range."

// Wendigo GL3
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Is the current meta open enough to allow Wendigo to flex its tired muscles? I think so. GLs aren’t oppressive in PvP but they offer better in between than a rocket or a machine gun. It can clear rooms quickly and do decent single target damage. With a linear fusion rifle nerf incoming we might see a rise in grenade launcher usage. With Wendigo being at the top of the list. Spike will give you damage, but better utility might be blinding.

Putting it in a range class well above its stats. It can also roll Iron Grip for a whopping +20 stability without sacrificing your barrel and magazine perks to stability. The only other auto rifle in this class to compete with Dark Decider would be Krait and given comparable rolls (DD - hammer-forged, accurized, iron grip, rangefinder / K - hammer-forged, ricochet, overflow, moving target) Dark Decider would have 2 whole meters over Krait.

With auto-loading holster you won’t have to worry about reload speed and you’ll get all the benefits of a bigger magazine with appended mag. Finally there’s target lock. This season’s newest perk. Target lock will increase your damage the longer you stay on target. With backup mag and appended mag you cap out your magazine at 75.

The Origin Trait is aimed more at 3v3 game modes, where you're less likely to be near a team mate to gain the better ADS and strafe speed.

Ignore the recoil direction, as this is a precision frame, so you can use the barrel to fill in your favoured stat - this does have the lowest zoom of its peers so you can either try and compensate with range, or live with it and improve stability.

The Origin Trait is aimed more at 3v3 game modes, where you're less likely to be near a team mate to gain the better ADS and strafe speed. Reasonably competitive out of the box with a subfamily TTK of 0.8s with 8 crits and 1 body shot), and an accuracy-adjusted TTK of 1.00s (7c, 3b) which only needs the smallest of damage boosts to improve as at v6.2.5. Unfortunately, stats are pretty weak across the board - the 50 Recoil Direction and joint lowest zoom means that, even with a recoil direction-correcting or stability barrel, you'll will still probably find a Counterbalance mod necessary. You really need both more range and more stability, once you've sorted the recoil direction, so Ricochet Rounds are your best mag perk. In the first trait column, Rangefinder will help push out range with an extra point of zoom. The second trait column is a bit short on PvP picks, but Golden Tricorn is the most reliable damage perk. One stack after a kill drops TTK down to 0.73s (7c, 1b) and accuracy-adjusted TTK to 0.8s (5c, 4b). If you manage to proc both stacks, this drops further to a lightning-fast TTK of 0.47s (6c) or an accuracy-adjusted TTK of 0.67s (4c, 3b).

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 34. PvE first-choice roll for minor add control in end-game content. Probably only necessary if you've not already got a Blinding Grenade roll on an Ignition Code or Pardon Our Dust. Handling and Velocity are what you need in your barrel, and Quick Launch delivers both. Blinding Grenades is always great for easier add control, particularly in crowds, and there's a case for both Quickdraw or Lead From Gold in your first trait column, paired with Auto-Loading Holster in the second so that you always have a shot ready. Recommended MW: Velocity or Handling - there's really nothing much a mod can add directly as you're not aiming for kills, so maybe Backup Mag mod's increase ammo reserves is the best option, but feel free to plug in what works for you. |tags: PvE, PvE-God, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-EndGame, Controller, MKB

Militia's Birthright has not really seen too many changes from its former self. Ambitious and auto-loading are funny together, but unfortunately do not proc one another. Lead from gold is another fantastic perk when paired with a full lead from gold build. Frenzy is the top choice for the final column. Having two grenades with the 15% damage increase, 50 handling, and the most important part being the 50 reload.

While it is great to cross compare weapons like that, all it does is allow for loadout diversity. Neither is “superior” because realistically you will not be making the choice of Fatebringer vs Zaouli's Bane, you will have your special weapon combination as well to consider. Want to use Izanagi's Burden or Arbalest? cannot use Fatebringer, the choice has been made for you.

Use the barrel to round out your preferred Range/ Stability/ Handling stat, and then you want as many bullets in the mag as possible with Tactical Mag or Appended Mag plus the Backup Mag mod, to help with the origin trait boost. It's not common to get Pugilist and Demolitionist on the same weapon, so take advantage to melee everything and throw all the grenades.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "it shipped super underwhelming. DFA has a lot of competition in its slot. From the hugely popular Fatebringer to the fan favorite Dire Promise, from the OG Eyasluna to OG Austringer. Not even including the exotic kinetic hand cannons, DFA has a high hill to climb. The benefit DFA has over some of the other weapons is the possibility of getting adept rolls for the bonus masterworks and adept mods. This doesn’t entirely cover the fact that DFA’s perk pool just shipped underwhelming. Outlaw and rampage are tried and true but extremely boring. Vorpal weapon is great and makes DFA the first kinetic 140 with vorpal, but that alone doesn’t bring it up past some of the aforementioned powerhouses."

In 3s it can be obtainable but is also hard to keep up once you start shooting. Perpetual motion is the best for adding stability and handling, two stats DFA does need. Opening shot coupled with fragile focus could make for some deep clean ups but the fall off of both will be very harsh." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 278 with @Critbuff. First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining. As with all playlist weapons, the more reputation resets you can get, the more trait options you'll get to play with, otherwise you've only got a 1/144 chance of any pair of traits dropping, before you even look at barrel, mag and masterwork. You have access to the best PvP Origin Perk in Suros Synergy in a solid Pulse Rifle subfamily, needing only the smallest of damage buffs to go from a TTK of 0.93s with the first bullet of a third burst (6 crits, 1 body), to a 0.6s six crit kill. Stats are on the low side, including a truly terrible Recoil Direction of 50, so you will need a Counterbalance mod even with Arrowhead Brake, but you'll also benefit from its reduction of 30 bounce intensity, or you can also try to control by adding as much stability as you can. With the mag, Ricochet Rounds or Flared Magwell round out the stats, adding some needed Stability. For a kill-chaining roll, Heating Up will help after your first kill with both stability to keep your reticule on target and reducing accuracy cone degredation to make crit shots easier. Then one stack of Rampage or Kill Clip is all you need for the two-burst kill, or Rampage x3 or Muiltikill Clip x2 will reduce TTK to 0.53s with just 4 crits and 1 body shot.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Yesteryear is a fun addition to the 390 archetype. I am slightly disappointed you need arrowhead brake to make this weapon feel good. Coupled with a counterbalance mod and you hit the sweet spot of 95. Outlaw makes a return as the best reload perk. Which is unfortunate seeing as rapid hit is objectively better. Subsistence is another great option but loses value in higher end content. Focused fury paired with rapid hit would be an incredible combo on a primary, if Yesteryear would have gotten that combo it would be the only pulse rifle in the game with those two perks at the same time.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. The Origin Perk is aimed at CQC, so should be useful here. Shapeable. Rapid-fire sidearms have competitive TTK as at v6.2.0.6, and the stats compare well in the slot but it's hard to look past Drang if you're thinking about energy sidearms. Range is really constrained in sidearms, so you could add an extra 0.75m or boost handling or stability with your barrel and mag. With the traits, lean into an aggressive playstyle and shape a kill-chaining weapon with Hip-Fire Grip to improve hip-fire performance, or Threat Detector or Perpetual Motion to add to your gunfeel stats in the first trait column, and your choice of Swashbuckler or Surrounded, both of which can reduce your TTK dramatically when fully procced in the second.

Shapeable. If you are going to shape one for kill-chaining, to tuck away just in case, just lean into CQC and add as much stability as you can with barrel and mag and then take advantage of the synergy between Pugilist and Swashbuckler - this could work well on Stasis classes using abilities to freeze and then melee an opponent (also proccing the origin trait) to go on a tear with fully-procced Swashbuckler, and additionally building into Font of Might on your armour mods for even more damage.

Not that great as a subfamily in PvP, in un-perked form, but very responsive to any damage buff - Radiant, Empowering Rift and High Energy Fire mean you can achieve a 3-crit kill in 0.67s against any resilience, as at v6.2.0.7. Doom has lower stability and zoom than comparators - this helps with your sight picture, but means the recoil isn't constrained quite as much. It should still be fairly easily controllable, so you can spec into Handling, and maybe a little bit of reload in your barrel and mag.

// Tarnished Mettle (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), Steady Rounds, Moving Target, (Eye of the Storm, Explosive Payload)
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. Not a great TTK as at v6.2.0.6, and the Origin Perk is really aimed at CQC, so won't be much use. Shapeable. In-band stats except for the high Airborne Effectiveness (if you wanted to jump shoot with a Scout!). The lethality perks are difficult to proc to a level where they make any meaningful difference, so aim to shape yourself something close a legendary MIDA for duelling. You can either help sort out the wonky Recoil Direction with Arrowhead Brake, or look to add stability with your barrel. You don't really need to worry about range, so Steady Rounds gives you even more stability and increases AE to 25. A Targeting mod or two on your helmet and Enhanced Moving Target can get you close to 100 Aim Assistance. Finally Enhanced Eye of the Storm just makes landing crits in combat easier or Explosive Payload crits at 200RPM can seriously mess with an opponent's day.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “I am so very glad Militia's Birthright is back. Mostly for my friend u/The_SpellJammer. Militia's Birthright has not really seen too many changes from its former self. Ambitious and auto-loading are funny together, but unfortunately do not proc one another. Lead from gold is another fantastic perk when paired with a full lead from gold build. Frenzy is the top choice for the final column. Having two grenades with the 15% damage increase, 50 handling, and the most important part being the 50 reload. The reload alone will max out your reload stat making it easier to reload into ambitious assassin.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Grenade Launcher Special Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 264 conversation with @pattycakesGG. PvP first-choice A-Tier roll for duelling.

Push out range and zoom as far as you can with your barrel, mag and Masterwork, mixing in stability if you need help to control the recoil. Fragile Focus can help boost initial range in an engagement, until you take damage, and Eye of the Storm will kick in as you take damage to improve accuracy.

// Strident Whistle
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Precision frames are some of the better choices for bows in PvP. Strident Whistle would need to have the lowest charge time of 576 to even compete in PvP. Fiberglass arrow shaft brings the accuracy back up after elastic string lowers it. Archer’s tempo is still great here, as is explosive head for double flinch. Moving target is a great pick if you feel you use your bow for follow up shots instead of bow-swap. Successful warm-up paired with archer’s tempo is incredible for some really fast draw times, but it feels almost “kill clip-esque” with successful warm-up needing a kill to activate."

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 278 with @Critbuff. First-choice PvP pick for kill chaining. As will all playlist weapons, the more reputation resets you can get, the more trait options you'll get to play with, otherwise you've only got a 1/144 chance of any pair of traits dropping, before you even look at barrel, mag and masterwork, although at least 50% of them are good PvP traits, which makes getting a usable roll a little easier. You have access to an excellent PvP origin perk for SMGs in Omolon Fluid Dynamics, in a solid SMG subfamily, needing only the smallest of damage buffs to go from a TTK of 0.67s with 11 crits and 1 body, to a 0.6s 8 crit, 2 body kill. Stats are on the low side, and with a Zoom of only 14, you'll never compete with a range specced Multimach or Shayura's, so focus on making this as good a CQC SMG as you're likely to meet. Add as much Handling and Stability as you can with barrel and mag so you can keep the reticule on target for crits. It's not really necessary to look further than Dynamic Sway Reduction in the first trait column, which pairs with the Omolon origin trait to keep your bullets on target through the magazine, and Golden Tricorn is the best damage perk - one stack gets you to the 0.6s TTK and two stacks to 0.47s with 6 crits and 2 body shots.

// Out of Bounds
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “The newest crucible weapon is only the slightest bit a disappointment for me. it is an Omolon 900 without phase mag. If you were not around in d2y1 or missed getting a good Stochastic Variable in Season of the Splicer, phase mag is a special Omolon magazine that drops the rpm from 900 (lightweight) to 600 (precision), and increases the damage profile to match the precision frames. The smg keeps its other stats, and retains the lightweight profile, but just hits like a precision frame. Not having that on an Omolon smg just feels wrong. Especially when it is not going to be better than regular lightweights or precision frame smgs. I digress. In most activities you will either have on Funnelweb or CALUS-Mini Tool. Out of Bounds acts as an arc alternative. With how good some arc 3.0 ability cycling is, you can almost guarantee two stacks of golden tricorn. Paired with subsistence to really tear down hordes of enemies. Out of Bounds is not going to be the best, and getting one is going to take some time. But it might just be one of the best arc weapons to use with the new subclasses.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Arc Submachine Gun Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Wastelander M5 (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Barrel Shroud, Full Choke, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling), Assault Mag, Slideshot, Opening Shot
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 279 with @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Shapeable. The Hot Swap origin trait works well for PvP, boosting handling when swapping to the weapon while damaged for quick swaps and ADS speed. The Lightweight frame suits aggressive, mobile playstyles, boosting sprint speed by 6.25% and passively adding 20 mobility to help close gaps quickly - you'll need to hit 11 out of 12 pellets for a kill at any resilience. Good all-round stats within the subfamily. For Lightweights, range needs to be over 80 to give a 6.28m range - aim to get to 55 with your barrel, mag and masterwork, without hurting handling or projectile spread. Then Slideshot will add 20, and Opening Shot another 25 to get to 100, which pushes the range out to 7m. Just remember to ABS (always be sliding), and always follow up with a melee!

// (Barrel Shroud, Full Choke, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling), Accurized Rounds, Slideshot, Opening Shot
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 279 with @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Shapeable. The Hot Swap origin trait works well for PvP, boosting handling when swapping to the weapon while damaged for quick swaps and ADS speed. The Lightweight frame suits aggressive, mobile playstyles, boosting sprint speed by 6.25% and passively adding 20 mobility to help close gaps quickly - you'll need to hit 11 out of 12 pellets for a kill at any resilience. Good all-round stats within the subfamily. For Lightweights, range needs to be over 80 to give a 6.28m range - aim to get to 55 with your barrel, mag and masterwork, without hurting handling or projectile spread. Then Slideshot will add 20, and Opening Shot another 25 to get to 100, which pushes the range out to 7m. Just remember to ABS (always be sliding), and always follow up with a melee!

// Pardon Our Dust (PvE backup roll)
// (Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control), Blinding Grenades, Auto-Loading Holster, (Demolitionist, Pugilist)
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 30. PvE backup roll for end-game content. Another opportunity to get a kinetic Blinding Grenade Launcher, if you haven't already - an essential tool in any end-game toolbox. Unfortunately, Danger Zone has been lost in its re-issued format, so there's no complementary trait in the last column. You'll be swapping back and forth, so go for a handling barrel. Obviously Blinding Grenades in the mag, and then Auto-Loading Holster to reload while you're mopping up your blinded enemies with your Energy weapon. As there's not that much in the second column of traits, but if you do manage to catch an add or two, you might as well try to get some ability energy out of it.

Unless you’re going for style points hot swapping to this sniper for montages the better choice is Firmly Planted.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Shapeable. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Decent in-slot stats compared to Exile's Curse or Wizened Rebuke. Generally, with fewer bolts being fired from a High-Impact frame, you don't have to worry so much about stability, so can either push the range or improve handling with your barrel. Increasing the battery size with Ionised Battery and Reservoir Burst pushes you to the maximum of 8 in the mag (with Enhanced RB you only need Enhanced Battery). You can get around the reload penalty from Ionised Battery when crouching with Field Prep (and have more ammo in reserve) to use in combination with Reservoir Burst. With a battery size of eight, you'll get up to five overflowed shots with the origin trait if you're in a Raid near a full fireteam, or three reloading in a normal fireteam of three.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Shapeable. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Decent in-slot stats compared to Exile's Curse or Wizened Rebuke. Generally, with fewer bolts being fired from a High-Impact frame, you don't have to worry so much about stability, so can either push the range or improve handling with your barrel. Any Battery with Backup Mag pushes you up to eight shots in the battery, so why not take advantage of a shorter charge time from Accelerated Coils? Further build into the faster charge time with Cornered, add ammo reserves and faster reloads with Field Prep, or trigger health regeneration on kills with Unrelenting in the first trait column. With a battery size of eight, you'll get up to five overflowed shots with the origin trait if you're in a Raid near a full fireteam, or three reloading in a normal fireteam of three.

On one hand it is still a strong aggressive frame shotgun that can get adept mods. On the other hand so is the Timelost Found Verdict and VoG is less of a challenge. Master VoG will still kick an unprepared ass, but will not be nearly as difficult as it used to be. To make Mindbender's Ambition work in the crucible you will have to invest into range and handling. Threat detector will take up a decent chunk of handling by speeding up the ready animation. But barrel shroud an a handling masterwork paired with quick charge will get you the rest of the way to where you want to be. Fragile focus and accurized rounds will take up your range, so long as you do not get hit to keep fragile focus up.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Solar Shotgun Special Ammo)|tags:PvP, Controller

// Mindbender's Ambition (Adept)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP Controller): Recommended MW: Handling “In PvP you can make arguments for and against the return of Mindbender's Ambition. On one hand it is still a strong aggressive frame shotgun that can get adept mods. On the other hand so is the Timelost Found Verdict and VoG is less of a challenge. Master VoG will still kick an unprepared ass, but will not be nearly as difficult as it used to be. To make Mindbender's Ambition work in the crucible you will have to invest into range and handling. Threat detector will take up a decent chunk of handling by speeding up the ready animation. But barrel shroud an a handling masterwork paired with quick charge will get you the rest of the way to where you want to be. Fragile focus and accurized rounds will take up your range, so long as you do not get hit to keep fragile focus up.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Solar Shotgun Special Ammo)|tags:PvP, Controller

// Pure Poetry
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Pure Poetry is a fantastic addition to the 120 family. With both Crimil's Dagger and Steady Hand being removed from the Iron Banner loot pool there really is only Loud Lullaby in the kinetic slot. Pure Poetry is not the best option, but it is nice to have it. The best benefit over Loud Lullaby is when you get a few resets in for your vanguard rep and have multiple perks within each column. For PvE outlaw is going to be your best friend. It can allow you to completely ignore reload and invest into handling or stability for your preference. Another great option is the newly buffed ambitious assassin to also circumvent the low mag / low reload speed. In the fourth column you cannot go wrong with any number of damage perks. Frenzy, rampage, harmony, focused fury, multikill clip, or the new pugilist. Any and all of them are fantastic, but slightly player dependent.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Hand Cannon Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with @DefyFly. First choice PvP roll for duelling. The main draw for Hung Jury as at v6.2.0.6 is Box Breathing in the second trait column, which means you can three tap any resilience (2 Crit + 1 Body of a 0.67s TTK) and two tap tap lower resiliences, as at Season 18 v6.2.0.6. To proc it though, you need to almost treat the weapon like it needs pre-charging by ADS-ing before an ancounter, It goes without saying, you need to land crits and stay mobile. You don't need extra range, so focus on Handling and stability with your barrel and mag. Rapid Hit helps further with Stability (as well as a Reload Speed boost), Moving Target adds a little extra crit stickiness or Surplus adds gunfeel boosts, as long as you hang on to your abilities.

// Boudica-c
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP Controller): Recommended MW: Stability or Handling “In PvP this archetype feels good when it works, but when it does not you feel like you are fighting the gun more than the newest hunter build. Swashbuckler will give you an incredibly forgiving time to kill, paired with moving target for the passive aim assist and strafe speed. If sidearm airborne effectiveness was fine enough to exist without major increases to feel good, I would wholeheartedly recommend at least trying this sidearm in PvP, until then vault it for a rainy day.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo)|tags:PvP, Controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Allied Demand is a great weapon to see come back. I love the 300 rpm adaptive frame sidearms. Something about them just feels best. Not quite the bullet hoses of the 450s, a little less fatiguing on the finger than the 360s, and feel better than the 260s for me. In PvE I really would not take a sidearm into any serious activities. They just do not have the damage or the range you would want to make them feel as effective. To make this sidearm feel as good as possible I would recommend bumping up the handling and stability. Sure you will not be able to shoot as far, but you are using a sidearm. Be real here. Frenzy is great for getting that quick damage and reload.

With rangefinder in the third column you can really opt for anything within that final column and be okay. Eye of the storm is a perfect pairing because you will definitely be taking damage to get into sidearm range to begin with. Multikill clip gives you that slaying potential. If you wanted to invest fully into range you can do so and you will hit 18.95m, but I would suggest going to hammer-forged, losing that extra meter and dropping to 17.96 so you will not lose any stats. 18.95 m (max), 17.96 without losing stats“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo)|tags:PvP, Controller

// Whistler's Whim (Adept)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Accuracy “I feel like this will be a havil sought after weapon. For two reasons, adept mods, and kill clip. Being a lightweight frame combat bow, Whistler's Whim does not need a lot to hit the draw time floor. Polymer string is enough and you will not have to sacrifice as much accuracy to do so. I do not think kill clip is the play for PvE but you can certainly make it work and I would love to see it. Look for other damage increasing perks like swash or AJ.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Bow Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

This takes the crit damage from 24 (72 per burst) to 31.92 (95.76 per burst) which gives you an incredibly easy three burst kill. Either way you’ll need all three bursts to kill but anything to make kills easier is a bonus. The 540 RPM makes firing at the full RPM incredibly difficult without the full auto retrofit.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "With triple tap, fourth time’s the charm, and actium war rig, you could fire forever. In most cases that is entirely a meme, but against specific bosses it could be useful to have. A more utilitarian roll would be triple tap with vorpal weapon to slot in adept big ones when the grandmaster nightfalls release. Ideally you want to bring up the recoil direction from the base 60, but chambered compensator or extended barrel won’t do as much, and you won’t want to slot a counterbalance mod in favor of any of the spec mods. Arrowhead then becomes the only choice to really improve that recoil to something more desirable. Other options are then just to make the gun feel better. Stats for all pairs really well with one for all, but also fourth time’s the charm or vorpal for a better feeling gun. And perpetual motion will elevate the gun feel without needing to shoot.".

// Enyo-D
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Precision frame smgs struggle in PvE content. Both of the 900 rpm smgs just pump out damage faster, and aggressive frames hit like a truck while still maintaining a lot of that spray. Precision frames have the best base range for all smgs but comically low handling, reload, and stability. All three of which are important in PvE activities. Reload especially. Enyo-D comes equipped with feeding frenzy to circumvent the low reload, and fluted barrel will bump up that low handling. I like surrounded with surrounded spec for the best damage, but multikill clip coupled with feeding frenzy is a great option too." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Enyo-D
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Where I’ve heard the most chatter around Enyo-D is in the Crucible. People are calling it the Antiope-D 2.0 or the kinetic Shayura’s Wrath. I think both are true, but the Enyo-D still has some shortcomings when it comes to comparing against the both. Enyo-D does not have kill clip. Multikill clip is fine and good, but the immediate 33% damage bonus is incredible on any precision frame smg. Enyo-D also has less zoom than both. The zoom field has been condensed, but the 16 zoom smgs will still be some of the best out of the gate. Steady hands also brings up one of Enyo-D’s weakest stats and makes it feel incredibly fluid. Keep an eye out for this one." Recommended MW - Range.|tags:pvp,controller

Either way you’ll need all three bursts to kill but anything to make kills easier is a bonus. The 540 RPM makes firing at the full RPM incredibly difficult without the full auto retrofit.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 25. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Adaptive auto-rifles are still pretty competitive as at S17 v4.1.5.2. In the same slot as Duty Bound or Scathelocke, which both have better Zoom, so you might need a touch of either range or stability, depending on preference, to compensate. Arrowhead Brake helps tidy up the wonky recoil and one of the Combat Effect magazines adds a little range and some utility effect. For end-game, particularly solo, content, it's difficult to top Demolitionist and Osmosis to give you an additional element to help break shields.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 23. PvE first choice roll for endgame content. Although suffering by comparison with the Precision bow subtype, if you've got a good roll, it's maybe worth hanging onto in case they ever get a bit of love. Your aim is to maximise damage output by getting as many arrows into opponents as possible, so get the Reload and Draw Speed down as far as possible with your bowstring and arrow. Archer's Tempo helps further speed up your RPM and Explosive Head boosts damage, adds flinch and helps with anti-champion mods.

// Crisis Inverted
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "While Crisis Inverted doesn’t have the furthest range even with rangefinder it does have the best ease of use of almost any non-180 hand cannon. Omolon fluid dynamics adds a whopping +20 stability at the top half of the magazine. This puts you right into that 65-75 range of having the best return on your stability and that’s just for choosing the omolon trait over the crucible one. Meaning as long as you’re diligent in reloading you can keep that buff for every single engagement. You can then invest into range or handling to make the weapon feel perfectly yours. Another sleeper combo on the sleeper weapon would be moving target and elemental capacitor on stasis for all the zoom. Not like eager edge zoom, more like MIDA zoom.".

Not available as at S17 unfortunately, but arguably the strongest legendary PvP SMG in the game. Strong stats - almost auto-rifle range is possible. Push out the range as far as you can with barrel, mag and Masterwork - this is a precision frame with 95 recoil direction, so it fires straight up and down, and a 16 zoom scope helps constrain bullet spread when ADS. The combination of Tap the Trigger on initial trigger pull and Dynamic Sway Reduction as you keep firing should make it easy to land shots consistently. Masterwork: Range, with a Sprint Grip or Quick Access Sling, if you're playing aggressively, an Icarus Grip mod to build on the already good Airborne Effectiveness stat, or a Targeting Adjustor for more passive playstyles.|tags: pvp, pvp-god pvp-duel, controller

There's no Impulse Amplifier in the trait pool but Killing Wind provides a range of gunfeel boosts after a kill, and Surrounded with the Spec mod provides a 40% CQC damage boost. Crafting with a Surrounded Enhanced and Spec mod gives a 47% CQC damage boost which means that, if you're radiant, you can 1-tap.

// Perses-D
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "High-impact scouts have a weird spot within the crucible sandbox. With Vostok and Eternity coming back it allows some more long ranged options to dominate PvP. But Perses lacks in the two departments I want; ideally it would be snappy and have good stability to make my side easier in long range. You can fully send into handling and stability to offset the lower base stats, but you can’t go half way with it. Steady rounds on a scout rifle isn’t the worst idea because of the weapon types inherent range, so the loss of range really won’t hurt it either. Perpetual motion and either explosive payload or opening shot are the ideal perks to go really incentivise good crucible habits and make your shooting experience better, but if you don’t feel like moving around a lot you can opt for rapid hit instead to stay firmly planted at B flag."

// Duty Bound (Adept)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "With triple tap, fourth time’s the charm, and actium war rig, you could fire forever. In most cases that is entirely a meme, but against specific bosses it could be useful to have. A more utilitarian roll would be triple tap with vorpal weapon to slot in adept big ones when the grandmaster nightfalls release. Ideally you want to bring up the recoil direction from the base 60, but chambered compensator or extended barrel won’t do as much, and you won’t want to slot a counterbalance mod in favor of any of the spec mods. Arrowhead then becomes the only choice to really improve that recoil to something more desirable. Other options are then just to make the gun feel better. Stats for all pairs really well with one for all, but also fourth time’s the charm or vorpal for a better feeling gun. And perpetual motion will elevate the gun feel without needing to shoot.".

The two things that can bump up Father’s Sins in my book is the ease of getting one and crafting it to your liking, as well as having access to under pressure and opening shot. With a higher base aim assist than the likes of Occluded Finality and Shephard’s Watch it could see some use being the bullet bending sniper.

// Hero of Ages
//notes:pandapaxxy (Controller / PvE): "This is probably the best thing to come this season. It’s an incredible design. A second spin-to-win sword and comes with Chain Reaction? Heck yeah!

// False Promises
//notes: (PvP / Controller): Mercules904 (pretty good PvP/controller) - "What a great gun! I've been waiting for a Legendary High-Impact AR that felt like SUROS Regime with Dual Speed Receiver, and I think we've finally found one. Stat-wise it suffers from most of the same drawbacks that the other high impacts do, poor stability, low aim assist and handling, but for some reason the return to center speed of the reticle is much faster than I'm used to on the others guns in the archetype (like Halfdan) and so the low stability doesn't seem to have much of an effect of the usability of the weapon."|tags:pvp,controller

// Bygones (controller)
//notes:Mercules904 (must-have controller) - "This is definitely my favorite primary in the game, and has been since Forsaken. The archetype by default has an incredibly easy to hit optimal TtK and it's super forgiving of missed crits, stat-wise it is flat out great, and the perk combinations on it are second to none."
