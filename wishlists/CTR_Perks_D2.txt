// A Distant Pull
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload Speed. Rapid-Fire Frame(140) Stasis Sniper Rifle Special Ammo.  "A Distant Pull is an interesting sniper. Rapid-fire snipers aren’t meta but this one could be incredibly strong to keep within your vault. Collective Action is an incredibly useful buff as it can be applied on any subclass. Headstone gives you some great cover and add control, but I find it far less useful on a sniper. Triple Tap gives you some great utility against majors, bosses, or vehicles where you can continuously crit them. I don’t think this sniper will really shake up the meta, but it does offer some great utility on all classes. Jack of all trades, master of none." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// A Distant Pull
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): Recommended MW: Handling. Rapid-Fire Frame(140) Stasis Sniper Rifle Special Ammo.  "A Distant Pull is not going to be great in the Crucible. You can roll some really high handling, but without Snapshot Sights, some players won’t even look at it, and being a rapid-fire other players won’t even equip it. These snipers are not as dominant as they used to be before their double body nerf and haven’t seen the sun since. Moving Target and Opening Shot will bump up your aim assist to 100 and you can craft this sniper for either 90 range or 90 handling. While it has some amazing stats, the frame and lack of snapshot will just put it under." |tags:pvp,controller

// A Distant Pull (PvE first-choice roll)
// Fluted Barrel, Tactical Mag, Overflow, Explosive Payload
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 61 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XT0gPkoVSh3cM6gMtSupq?si=18db495353ca49ad) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors and sustained damage against Bosses in end-game content. Shapeable.

Unlocking the patterns and getting them ready in the event of a buff would be wise, but quick killing weapons with good forgiveness coupled with Target Lock are the name of the game. Age-Old Bond kills quickly but does not have much in terms of forgiveness. Target Lock drops your 6 crit requirement down to 5 crit 1 body, not changing the time to kill, but making it ever so slightly more forgiving.

Impact Casing adds 2.2% multiplicative damage in the magazine perk slot. In the first trait column as the support perk, you can have a choice of Reconstruction to passively overfill the barrel with 2 shots, or Demolitionist for the instant reload when throwing a grenade (and the extra damage from the grenade as well).

There will be some obvious testing to do this season, but I want this rocket launcher for the sheer fun of it. Cluster Bomb might be useful again when coupled with Frenzy or Golden Tricorn’s damage increase." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear in end-game activities. High-Impact Rocket Launchers are meant for add-clear - they have the highest blast radius stat of the subfamilies and do middling damage - 10% less than Adaptives or Aggressives. And saying that, BrayTech Osprey (Adept) has the worst stats in its subfamily. But there might be an interesting roll for burst damage worth looking at anyway. Increase the velocity stat with the barrel and masterwork - Quick Launch and Hard Launch are the best options, and Impact Casing adds 2.2% multiplicative damage. In the first trait column as the support perk, for burst damage against Majors or sustained damage against a Boss, Field Prep for the extra reserves, which means you only have to run two reserves mods for the maximum number of rockets, and have the reload speed boost when crouched. In the second trait slot as the signature perk, Bipod could be very interesting - two in the mag, even with the loss of damage being offset by less need to reload. Maybe one to keep, just in case.

// Bug-Out Bag
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability. Adaptive Frame(900) Solar Submachine Gun Primary Ammo.  "Bug-Out Bag returns to us. I didn’t love its original form, so let’s see if this is the redemption arc of the century. In PvE you might enjoy a 100 recoil direction, so Arrowhead Brake is the best call. All 900 RPM SMGs are bullet hoses, so I think that increasing the mag size is the best way to go. You could also completely circumvent reload through Subsistence. Another alternative is just bumping up your reload so the downtime between mags is reduced. Flared Magwell coupled with either Threat Detector or Perpetual Motion will bring down your reload speed from 1.86s to either 1.32s with TD2x or 1.47s with PM2x. The easiest damage bonus is Collective Action this season as it neutrally pairs with every subclass. Incandescent works better on Solar builds but can neutrally clear rooms." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

Hand cannons are not the most meta weapon to use in higher level PvE, but Voltshot combined with a low magazine can make it reliable and give you a reason to reload this hand cannon.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in general activities. The first rapid-fire legendary glaive, which looks like it offers high rate-of-fire, handling and reload speed, but lower range, impact and shield duration. Supercooled Accelerator seems like the best of the haft perks to boost the range, or Auxiliary Reserves helps shore up the Shield Duration, both at the cost of one or both of handling and reload. There's not really a top pick for your mag, except to avoid Extended Mag. For glaive melee fans, the combination of Disruption Break in the first trait slot as the support perk weakens targets by 50% to kinetic damage for 5.5s once you've broken their shield with a glaive bolt and guess what? Glaive melees are kinetic, so you can slash away to your heart's content. If enemies don't have a shield, Close to Melee in the second column as the signature perk boosts your glaive melee damage by 30% for 10s for getting a projectile kill, with the timer being refreshed by 5s after another melee kill.

The second of which is with Lead from Gold builds, the only issue with this is that most of the best weapons for double special builds reside in the energy slot.

I cannot think of many situations where that’s necessary, nor really a need to use a 120 RPM scout. This does break up the need for an exotic as both Long Arm and Last Rite are legendary and therefore allow some loadout variation.

// Nation of Beasts (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Extended Barrel, Chambered Compensator), Flared Magwell, (Perpetual Motion, Eddy Current), Voltshot
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 69 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZIEMYfNzOu5TyLlLhU7hH?si=90ffff909a2e40f2) with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects - @ImpetusAlways is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for minor add-clear in end-game activities, particularly for arc synergy. Shapeable. National of Beasts has average stats in comparison to its peers, but a spicy Raid perk pool to play with. Take your pick of a little extra range, stability or recoil speed for the barrel perk. In the magazine, Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell are both great choices - the difference being whether you prefer an bullets or a slightly faster reload. If you want to build into Voltshot as your second trait column signature perk, you'll want your first column support perk to boost reload speed as much as possible. The new Eddy Current sounds like it might do the job, but you'll have to sprinting for 3s after a kill to proc it, which gives you a tiny window to reload of 0.8s or less, so good old Perpetual Motion is probably the more reliable option. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

"New Pacific Epitaph is our newest Stasis grenade launcher, at first I was disappointed with no Chill Clip, but then I saw why. A wave frame GL. This brings back up my excitement. Wave frame grenade launchers are arguably the best GL to bring into any content. They are easy to use, reliable, and unless the architecture messes with you very easy to secure multikills with. Collective Action is the best for subclass agnostic builds. Redirection will make easy work of bigger targets, and hordes building up that damage. Kill Clip is simple because you always have to reload to fire." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

Incandescent kills count as weapon kills, so every energy that dies to scorch or ignite damage will grant 10% energy as well as direct kills.

The benefit Old Sterling has is in its frame. Being an adaptive frame might feel better to some users compared to Rufus;s Fury being a rapid-fire frame. Entirely dependent on how you like to shoot. Frenzy and Demolitionist I listed as being better perks only because Hatchling falls off incredibly quick on non-Strand builds.

You can also get away with the Discord shenanigans but with zoom decoupling from Rangefinder soon I wouldn’t rush out to get one.

// Randy's Throwing Knife
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability. Rapid-Fire Frame(260) Kinetic Scout Rifle Primary Ammo.  "Randy’s Throwing Knife is back! My favorite little scout-auto love child. This time with random rolls!!! I do enjoy seeing older ritual / pinnacle weapons refreshed with more options, especially post sunsetting. It does feel good grinding them out again. Randy’s Throwing Knife was the best rapid-fire scout for its time but unfortunately fell into a time where scouts were just awful to use and did not have a set place outside of MIDA Multi-Tool or a few specific options. Randy’s Throwing Knife with Kinetic Tremors will feel great as it fires fast enough to get the AoE back to back. Cascade Point is really funny to me, seeing a 260 scout bumping the RPM all the way up to 428 via D2Foundry. If this lands for me I don’t even really care about viability, it will just be fun." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

"The only problem with this submachine gun is the far too low stability. Rapacious Appetite has literally the lowest stability across all submachine guns in the game at 6. A whopping 6.

Well-Rounded does give some great stability to bring up Rapacious Appetite’s extremely low stability. One for All is the easiest damage bonus to get as you won’t need to get kills and your low stability will occasionally make crit kills harder, making Headstone less optimal.

In the mag, Flared Magwell bumps stats up a bit more, or Appended Mag gets you to the maximum of 14 shots. For end-game add clearing Rapid Hit is the best choice for the first trait column support park - stacking buffs to stability and reload speed or, if you can run and slide, Slideshot partially reloads and applies passive range and stability bumps. In the second column as the signature perk, Kinetic Tremors does currently (v7.1.0.2, S21) take six hits to proc, but if that's ever given a buff, this could be great for AoE damege for a group of adds while collecting ammo and orbs remotely.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in end-game content. Shapeable. Unfortunately, Targeted Redaction looks great, but has poor stats by comparison with other void adaptive hand cannons. If you already have a decent Bottom Dollar roll, you can probably give this a pass.

// Techeun Force
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Charge Time. Adaptive Frame(660) Arc Fusion Rifle Special Ammo.  "Techeun Force is looking to be the best fusion rifle in the game. I don’t say that often but given all the goodies of double damage perks, craftability, and great stats you can really have it your way. Rewind Rounds coupled with Collective Action for subclass agnostic buffs, Controlled Burst for laying down enemies or Golden Tricorn when on Arc will feel incredibly strong. Reconstruction is a tried and true gem of a perk, only beaten by my obsession with Overflow. Kill Clip can stack with all of these creating over 100% damage increases with Kill Clip, Golden Tricorn 2x, 3 Surge Mods, and Major Spec. If you set things up right you can almost have a 150% damage increase. Simply put it is the best fusion in the game for damage and has greater utility beyond that." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

"In PvP you could also recommend Techeun Force as the best fusion in the game and I will. Arrowhead Brake with a CB mod brings the recoil to 100, so you can invest the rest of the fusion into range via Projection Fuse and Rangefinder. If you value kill chaining you could go for Reconstruction and Controlled Burst for never reloading and getting that 20% damage increase. Another niche use case would be Kill Clip and Kickstart for a nice 4 bolt kill, you’d have to be sprinting immediately after reloading but the enhanced version extending Kill Clip’s timer will help you out." |tags:pvp,controller

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against majors and sustained damage against bosses in end-game activities. Shapeable. Techeun Force (however Saint Kabr pronounces it...) is reprised in a new, highly desirable perk set. I say set, it's really just one perk in particular. The stats to start are pretty good, although the recoil direction needs some attention, so Arrowhead Brake will take that to a controllable 90. For a damage roll, Liquid Coils is the obvious choice - don't worry, we'll get around the charge time penalty later. In the first trait slot, as the support perk, Rewind Rounds means you should be able to keep shooting until the battery is empty - you need a minimum of two shots in the mag to proc it, but then it reloads 2 shots from reserves. Finally, as the signature perk in the second trait slot, the new-for-S21 Controlled Burst drops your charge time by 10% and increases damage by 20% just for hitting all your bolts, making this great for burst and sustained damage. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear use in general activities. The reprised Messenger has a few new tricks for Season 21, which make it worth a look. Good stats across the board, except for recoil direction, which we can help out with Arrowhead Brake in the barrel slot, which takes it to a controllable 90. For the magazine perk, any of the "Rounds" mags or Flared Magwell work well. For your first trait column support perk, Rapid Hit and Perpetual Motion can both layer on addition gunfeel boosts on top. If you're running solo content, don't forget the Alacrity origin trait to pretty much max out every stat on the board, and add 10 Aim Assist too. Finally, in the second slot, for non-endgame content, Desperado can be fun, increasing your DPS output by 30% for 6s by reloading after a crit kill.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against bosses in end-game activities. Shapeable. The Supremacy has decent in-band stats by comparison with other kinetic slot rapid-fire snipers. Putting out shots at pace needs some additional control with the barrel perk - you could improve the recoil direction, or you can increase the stability. Appended Mag gets you to the maximum of 7 in the mag without needing to use Extended Mag. The roll that's been dubbed "Whisper Lite" combines Enhanced Rewind Rounds in the first trait column as the support perk refunds 70% of the shots that hit from reserves when the magazine's emptied. Fourth Time's the Charm in the second slot as the signature perk magics two bullets out of thin air after hitting four rapid crits. Between the two, it's been reported that with 3x Reserve mods you can hit 42 crits in a row without reloading - very handy to have in your back pocket against a boss if you run out of power ammo, or if you're running Tractor Cannon and need a damage option. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

Archer’s Tempo will get you the best reload / knock time, and Golden Tricorn is simply the best damage perk in the game. On solar that job gets even easier with the plethora of amazing abilities. Collective action will have slightly less uptime but could still be considered one of the better perks.

// Tyranny of Heaven (PvE first-choice roll)
// Elastic String, Straight Fletching, (Explosive Head, Dragonfly), Incandescent
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 69 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZIEMYfNzOu5TyLlLhU7hH?si=90ffff909a2e40f2) with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects - @ImpetusAlways is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for minor add-clear in end-game activities, particularly for solar synergy. Shapeable. Okay, it's a Lightweight bow, which isn't ideal but on the bright side, you do get the +20 mobility and 6.25% movement speed increase, and this is the only solar example available. The stats aren't great either but, as a Raid weapon, this can still roll with some spicy trait combinations. As usual, we'll use the combination of Elastic String in the bowstring slot, and Straight Fletching as the arrow to drop the draw time and recover the lost accuracy (it's already a pretty awful 27, so get used to using this closer up than a precision bow). The unique rolls available include Explosive Head for a straight 9.4% damage boost and tiny bit of AoE damage or Dragonfly for a more satisfying crit kill explosion in the first trait slot as the support perk, together with Incandescent as the second slot signature perk for scorch and ignite - even better with solar 3.0 verbs if you're running a matching subclass with access to useful fragments. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in end-game activities. Buzzard is a sidearm so it's likely to be less than optimal for end-game content, as you have to be very close to use one. It's got good stats overall, but the subfamily is all quite compressed. We can get pretty much every stat close to 100 with this particular roll, except for range so max that out with Full Bore in the barrel, a range Masterwork and any of the Combat Effect magazine perks. In the first trait column as the support perk, Encore wouldn't normally be under consideration, as it's mainly thought of as a PvP perk, but at four stacks it adds -5% accuracy cone growth for easier crits, 20 Range and 32 Stability. With Frenzy in the second trait slot as the signature perk procced, you end up with range of 86, stability of 89 or 99 (depending on the mag), and handling and reload speed at 100, as well as the useful 15% damage boost.

// Buzzard
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): Recommended MW: Range. Adaptive(300) Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo.  "Buzzard with Rangefinder will have a 17m range, going all into range will only bump that up to 18m. I would highly recommend just investing your stats into making the gun feel better as your range will just not bump up the same way.

// Buzzard (Adept) (PvE first-choice roll)
// Full Bore, (Ricochet Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds), Encore, Frenzy
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 68 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/7e93LMhFDUbZZX5SKYzXf0?si=cec8c26785114ffb) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in end-game activities. Buzzard is a sidearm so it's likely to be less than optimal for end-game content, as you have to be very close to use one. It's got good stats overall, but the subfamily is all quite compressed. We can get pretty much every stat close to 100 with this particular roll, except for range so max that out with Full Bore in the barrel, a range Masterwork and any of the Combat Effect magazine perks. In the first trait column as the support perk, Encore wouldn't normally be under consideration, as it's mainly thought of as a PvP perk, but at four stacks it adds -5% accuracy cone growth for easier crits, 20 Range and 32 Stability. With Frenzy in the second trait slot as the signature perk procced, you end up with range of 86, stability of 89 or 99 (depending on the mag), and handling and reload speed at 100, as well as the useful 15% damage boost. Recommended MW: Range, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, Controller, M+KB

// THE SWARM (PvE first-choice roll)
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 68 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/7e93LMhFDUbZZX5SKYzXf0?si=cec8c26785114ffb) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear in end-game activities. It's difficult to love the reprised SWARM for PvE when the best damage perk has been lost, and the PvE options in both trait columns are weak. The only viable use is for minor add-clear as a kind of heavy scout rifle, but if you already have an older Bottomless Grief/One For All roll, just keep that and move on. If you do want to hold on to one, you could make an argument for any barrel perk - Fluted Barrel, for the handling and stability, Polygonal Rifling, for the big stability bump or Full Bore for the range bump, for example. In the mag, Appended Mag adds extra bullets, Flared Magwell adds straight stability and Reload Speed or Tactical Mag does both. In the first trait column as the support perk, Feeding Frenzy and Well Rounded are the best of a limited bunch, while in the second slot as the signature perk, Golden Tricorn is much the only choice - a straight 15% damage boost on kills that can be boosted to 50% with an arc ability kill for occasional burst damage against Majors.

First-choice PvE roll for burst damage against Majors in end-game content. While slug shotguns aren't the burst damage meta they once were, they can still deal decent damage when the occasion demands. For the barrel, stability is a bit more important than normal, to keep your reticule on target, but Handling is still useful too. Assault Mag increases RPM to 70 to increase your damage output. As your first trait column support perk, Reconstruction or Fourth Time's The Charm both work to extend the magazine during a damage window and, for your second column signature perk, take your choice of Frenzy, Vorpal Weapon or Focused Fury to boost damage output with. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two.

Great stats - standard for trace rifles, but not quite as good as Hollow Denial. Difficult to work out what role it plays in the sandbox, effectively being a very accurate high ROF auto rifle that uses special ammo. The base accuracy-adjusted TTK is 0.8s wth 8 crits and 5 body shots, but small damage buffs do make it easier to use - Golden Tricorn x1 or Radiant get you to 0.73s TTK in 5 crits and 7 bodies, and if you can get Golden Tricorn x2 up (and have enough battery charge left), you can get an Accuracy-Adjusted TTK of 0.53s with 5 crits and 4 bodies. Choose a barrel that doesn't have any penalties and Tactical Battery provides a range of small gunfeel stat boosts.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 279 with @Saint_Kabr. Backup PvP pick for kill-chaining. Shapeable. The Hot Swap origin trait works well for PvP, boosting handling when swapping to the weapon while damaged for quick swaps and ADS speed. Great stats - standard for trace rifles, but not quite as good as Hollow Denial. Difficult to work out what role it plays in the sandbox, effectively being a very accurate high ROF auto rifle that uses special ammo. The base accuracy-adjusted TTK is 0.8s wth 8 crits and 5 body shots, but small damage buffs do make it easier to use - Radiant gets you to 0.73s TTK in 5 crits and 7 bodies. Choose barrel and mag perks that boost gunfeel and don't have any penalties. In the first trait column, Well-Rounded or Perpetual Motion both help further with gunfeel stats and, in the second, Incandescent's ignite can catch groups of opponents to make follow-up kills easier.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Rapid-fire frame shotguns have not had a strong presence in PvP either. Their recent change to a fixed spread will help but their poor ammo economy on top of the gamemodes 1 shot per brick leads to a bad taste. They can be strong when barrel stuffing your opponent, but any shotgun will do then. I would just stay away from rapid-fire shotguns until there is a really strong incentive to use them."

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “I get why Bungie had to change Qullim's Terminus from a 450 to a 360, that would make 3 raids that have 450 machine guns. But Bungie also knows that you cannot craft a Commemoration or Corrective Measure. So I feel like it should have been a 450. Nevertheless it is here as a 360 and we have to like it. Arrowhead will max out the recoil direction, and firing line will give you that big damage. I do not feel comfortable recommending use of a 360 in a raid or dungeon for maximum damage, but in a strike I could see it being a solid option.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Stasis Machine Gun Heavy Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

If you enjoy arc subclasses, Without Remorse is the reigning champion. If you play almost any other subclass, the Seventh Seraph CQC-12 is the best in slot."

"Briar’s Contempt might be better than Stormchaser or Fire and Forget. Being able to slot Adept mods is incredibly useful. That alongside Reconstruction and Frenzy could make for a solid DPS weapon. It loses 5 percent of damage without Firing Line but does make up for that in non-precision damage. Firing Line only deals bonus precision damage. Will the extra magazine make up for the lack of damage? I know Adept Big Ones will certainly make up for it.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload or Charge Time “Taipan-4fr is incredible for what it is. it is a craftable linear fusion rifle with perks that compare and get it close to things like Reed's Regret and Stormchaser. It lowers the barrier for entry and to be competitive if you do not play trials or dungeons. I love this for Bungie. More ways for players to get competitive loot out of the gate. Firing line, frenzy, or focused fury are all incredibly strong options.

But, even though this is a great roll, you'll still know in your heart that you really wanted Voltshot...

// Fixed Odds
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): " the nature and rpm of the high-impact frame machine guns makes them feel so slow. To make Fixed Odds feel a little less slow, run either arrowhead brake for the recoil direction or fluted barrel to bring up one of its worst stats. Any mag boosting perk is preferred in the second column. Feeding frenzy or field prep will depend on how you play, but both bring up another low stat. Finally depending on how you play, killing tally, firing line, or incandescent are all fantastic perks. If you’re using a Solar 3.0 subclass, incandescent and feeding frenzy make a great pairing. If you prefer any other subclass and are solo, killing tally will be phenomenal. Finally if you run group activities a lot, firing line and field prep will be excellent for boss or major dps."

I find frenzy works best on primary weapons, but a full arsenal of frenzy weapons means you won’t ever drop your damage buff." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Riptide
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "For a Crucible weapon it has some very good perks for the Crucible itself. You have two choices in the first column; perpetual motion for players constantly on the move; under pressure for players who prefer to play slower or if you completely dropped scavs in favor of other leg mods. Under pressure is great for Riptide with its 7 mag, but the extra 15 stability just for moving is hard to beat at any point in the magazine." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast Versus Enemies episode 48 with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for end-game activities. The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits (the amount depends on the weapon archetype). Pretty much best in-subfamily stats, but any kinetic sniper has to offer a lot to stand out from the crowd. If you decide this is for you, the best rolls are more for burst damage against majors and stunned Champions. Fluted Barrel adds handling and stability, or go all-in to stability with Polygonal Rifling. You can use Tactical Mag to add stability and reload speed, Alloy Mag to help with reloads on an empty mag, or maximise your magazine size with Extended Mag. For Majors, Reconstruction will double your magazine size (so you can get up to 10 in the mag with Extended Mag and a Backup Mag mod). If you're in a group, Firing Line provides a passive 20% bonus crit damage in a fireteam or, if you're running solo, Focused Fury can proc after three crit his, so your remaining shots have 20% bonus damage. Recommended MW: Handling or stability, with a Backup Mag, or damage-boosting (Major or Taken Spec) mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-MajorSpec, PvE-God, Controller, M+KB

// The Other Half (PvP first-choice roll)
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 280 with @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining. Shapeable. Swords aren't necessarily a top choice for PvP, as at v6.2.5, but this does come with a very useful perk in Eager Edge to close the gap unexpectedly on an opponent. Jagged Edge adds damage, and Swordmaster's Guard gets your power attack as quickly as possible. Eager Edge is your must have in the first trait column and Vorpal Weapon is the best of a very PvE orientated set of traits in the second.

Use your barrel to increase projectile speed without harming Blast Radius, and then High-Velocity Rounds adds Velocity and Reload Speed. Ambitious Assassin pairs with a trait in the last column to either help with damage or ability energy (and who doesn't love that?).

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast Versus Enemies episode 48 with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for end-game activities. The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits (the amount depends on the weapon archetype). Good stats and a stellar PvE perk pool make this an LMG worth chasing. You can choose to sort the recoil with Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator or Extended Barrel, or improve stability with Fluted Barrel or Polygonal Rifling. Most mag choices could have a role - boost your magazine size with Tactical, Appended or Extended Mag. Killing Tally is the easiest to proc damage boosting perk if you're killing adds - 3 kills equals 30% bonus damage until you stow or reload, which you won't have to do much with Subsistence refreshing your magazine, so you could keep firing until you're empty.

// Heritage (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Fluted Barrel, Smallbore), (Assault Mag, Tactical Mag), Reconstruction, Focused Fury
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast Versus Enemies episode 48 with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for Majors in end-game activities. The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits (the amount depends on the weapon archetype). Great kinetic slug shotgun - good stats across the board. While they're no longer the pillar for majors and boss damage they once were, they still work well as a weapon to swap to for burst or sustained damage. Fluted Barrel or Smallbore are your barrel choices for extra stability with a side order of handling or range depending on your preference. Assault Mag's increased fire rate is effectively a 7.7% boost to DPS, or Tactical Mag lets you get to the maximum of 8 in the mag with a Backup Mag mod. Reconstruction overfills your magazine to double size which means you only need to hit three or four crits, depending on how close you get to the magazine limit, for 11s (12s with the Enhanced Perk) for a 20% damage boost for the remainder of the magazine with Focused Fury. Recommended MW: Handling or Range, with a Backup Mag, or damage-boosting (Major, Boss or Taken Spec) mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-MajorSpec, PvE-BossSpec, PvE-God, Controller, M+KB

Now then, why Vorpal? Well, it just feels like the best of the bunch for passive PvP usage. More damage on supers good. As for Flared Magwell over Ricochet or Hi-Cal, I like my stability bumped up when possible and there's nothing worse than being caught mid reload on something as heavy as a 750. Loader mods will help, but Flared is worth the investment for me." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. Unfortunately, this doesn't have great stats or any unique perk options by comparison with other aggressive frame SMGs, but drops will rain down during Guardian Games, so that's not unexpected (maybe it's just Hakke's unfamiliarity with energy weapons 😉). Season 20 has lost the S-Tier Stats/One for All combination, unfortunately. If you want to tuck one away, push out the range with your barrel and magazine, even at the cost of stability or handling, as we'll be getting that back with the traits, and the Recoil Direction of 85 is pretty much vertical. Full Bore and Ricochet Rounds add a few metres of useful range. In the first trait column as your support perk, if you're not proccing Threat Detector's bonus Stability, Handling and Reload Speed, you're just doing it wrong. Similarly with Surrounded as your second column signature perk - although it's not the Enhanced version, you'll still have 40% bonus damage when procced in CQC. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy? Or, if you're up against vehicles and constructs, Hakke Breach Armaments will help burst them down.

It is better than Cold Front in every stat except for handling and recoil direction. The Title doesn’t have any good reload perks other than artificially increasing the magazine through Envious Assassin, moving with Perpetual Motion, or having enemies near you with Threat Detector. I don’t know about you but I sometimes prefer just a good reload perk. Threat Detector and Surrounded will make quick work of just about any horde mode, but falls off as soon as you’re out of combat. Vorpal is plain Jane damage and Repulsor Brace only works with void debuffs.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): Recommended MW: Range or Stability. Aggressive(750) Void Submachine Gun Primary Ammo.  "In PvP there is little to discuss. Rangefinder is best in slot and Perpetual Motion does make up for a good chunk of stats. Dynamic Sway Reduction also brings up the “stability” but I find it still needs more. 20 stability is just way too low. If you can swing it, it would be a good alternative to all the Immortals we are seeing." |tags:pvp,controller

// Taraxippos
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Speedy reloads and threadlings? Heck yeah boi. Definitely go for Arrowhead Brake so you have a decent recoil direction. Lightweight scouts don't need much but anything helps. Tactical Mag or Appended Mag are going to be the best here. Small shout out to Flared Magwell, but with Outlaw you won't need a lot of reload. I'd take more bullets for this one." Recommended MW: Handling.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Taraxippos
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Moving Target is arguably the best in slot for the third column, and kill clip will allow for some spicy three taps. Definitely keep an eye out for this one. Again Arrowhead Brake is recommended for allowing you to focus less on controlling the recoil and more about crits. Steady Rounds will bump up the stability meaning you have less jump each shot. You shouldn't have to worry about the range drop as scouts have different metrics for range. Handling or stability for masterwork depending on how fast you like your weapons." Recommended MW: Handling.|tags:pvp,controller

// Taraxippos
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Everybody is going to be looking for Hatchling on this thing, so I'm not unique in that respect. A strand scout is new and unique, so leaning into that newness and uniqueness is great, absolutely worth it. However.. I am not going to be looking for Outlaw, instead I'm looking for FTTC. Just to be a bit special? Yes. But also, Tactical Mag should bring the gun to a nice 16 mag size, which will play nicely with FTTC. The reload from Tac and MW will be more than enough and they don't have a kill condition, so personally I don't think I need outlaw. Obligatory Arrowhead because even on a scout rifle, 54 RD is brutal." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Taraxippos
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvP / Controller): "I just need to shoutout that Kill Clip is right there in slot 4 also, and that would be great too. However, my thought process with this roll is that I want to make any given engagement as easy for me as possible (High stab, Zen Moment) while also being as much of a nuisance for the enemy as I can (Low flinch intake, Explosive Payload) So while I do think the KC 3 taps will go hard, I'm here to be a menace, not a slayer."

// Taraxippos
//notes:Sneecher (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "A new Strand weapon enters the fray! I'm always excited to get a new weapon type to add to my toolbox, and this weapon immediately gives us the Outlaw/Hatchling combo I've been waiting for (I still love you Round Robin). I expect to have a lot of dumb fun with this gun in PVE, especially in activities with a Strand surge (AKA all of them this season). Warlocks in particular should enjoy this combo, especially with Thread of Evolution, the Classy Contender trait, and an Empowering rift. That being said, Threadlings aren't the strongest choice for endgame PVE, and Lightweight frame scouts aren't my favorite in GMs either, so I expect this will just be a roll for fun, rather than a top tier PVE weapon. If you are intent on using this for GMs, you'll want Explosive Payload or maybe even Focused Fury instead." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Taraxippos
//notes:Sneecher (PvP / Controller): "There are a lot of options for PVP on this weapon, which took me a bit by surprise. If you like scouts at all, I am sure there is a roll for you somewhere in here. As a console player myself, I thoroughly enjoy high stability rolls. Scouts have such good coverage that they can handle a slight hit to range in favor of landing more shots quickly. Encore is a perk I think a lot of people sleep on, but after the rework it can be very effective in 6v6 modes. Add No Distractions and the Omolon origin trait, and you’ve got a workhorse ready to excel in all stats." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

// Taraxippos (PvE first-choice roll)
// Arrowhead Brake, (Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell), Fourth Time's The Charm, Explosive Payload
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 61 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/35xKd0TwFvvOyymsE9Wp5H) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. Named after a ghost that frightened horses at a particular spot on the Olympia race course during ancient games there. Our first Lightweight Strand scout rifle has only one direct kinetic slot competitor in Night Watch, and is pretty comparable in stats, although will do 10% less damage, as a non-kinetic weapon. For min-maxxers, the +30 Mobility from the intrinsic perk can help to flesh out builds. Taraxippos is fast-firing, so you will need to tidy up the 54 Recoil Direction. Arrowhead Brake in the barrel takes it to a manageable 84. In the magazine, Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell both offer useful boosts to stability and reload speed (and an extra shot for Tac Mag). Fourth Time's The Charm in the first trait column as your support perk is always welcome to extend your mag size, while Explosive Payload in the second column as the signature perk adds 30% damage with no falloff, and is useful when Scouts are the seasonal anti-Overload Champion mod, only needing two shots to disrupt. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy? Or, Omolon Fluid Dynamics adds stability and reload speed to the top half of your mag. Recommended MW: Range, Stability or Handling - just go with your preference, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-Champion, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, Controller, M+KB

Taking a look at both shotguns with Barrel Shroud, Accurized, Threat Detector, Opening Shot, and a Range masterwork / frame. Even with an adept Range mod on Atral Horizon both shotguns have the same range stat of 79, handling is actually best on Imperial Decree by 2 (43 to 41).

// Astral Horizon (Adept)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): Recommended MW: Range. Aggressive(55) Kinetic Shotgun Special Ammo.  "Most Crucible players should rejoice over this shotgun returning. The issue lies in its competition. Imperial Decree is easier to farm, has comparable stats, and while not getting adept mods, is able to stay stat for stat compared to Astral Horizon (Adept). Taking a look at both shotguns with Barrel Shroud, Accurized, Threat Detector, Opening Shot, and a Range masterwork / frame. Even with an adept Range mod on Atral Horizon both shotguns have the same range stat of 79, handling is actually best on Imperial Decree by 2 (43 to 41). Meaning it might just be better to farm out an Imperial Decree unless you really like glow on your weapons." |tags:pvp,controller

We have gotten a few new aggressive frame shotguns recently, especially within this DLC. The interesting thing about this shotgun is the inclusion of Nanotech Tracer Rockets pushes this shotgun a little over the edge compared to its brothers and sisters. You will want to increase Basso Ostinato’s handling to make swaps a lot less painful. Envious Assassin and Grave Robber are great options depending on what you’re using this shotgun for and with. If you are using Basso Ostinato as a DPS weapon or mob killer, then something like Trench Barrel or Destabilizing Rounds will be perfect with Envious Assassin. If you punch a lot you can pair Grave Robber with either of the punchy perks." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

You'll want to be able to control the recoil, so look for stability or recoil direction in a barrel, and Enhanced Battery adds a useful extra shot. For boss damage, both Rewind Rounds and Reconstruction, as your first trait column support perk, overfill or refill the magazine, or alternatively Demolitionist provides an instant reload to keep damage uptime for Frenzy's 15% damage boost as your second trait column signature perk. The additional 50 Reload Speed from Frenzy is handy, once you do need to reload, too. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two. Recommended MW: Stability - just go with your preference, with a damage-boosting (Boss or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod|tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-BossSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, Controller, M+KB

First-choice PvE roll for add clear in end-game activities. Shapeable.

Blast Radius only affects the initial impact, not the width of the wave so use the barrel to boost velocity and handling. Out of the two options for the mag, High Velocity Rounds is always the better one, improving Reload Speed too. There's an abundance of options for PvE in the first trait column, but the best option is Envious Assassin, passively overflowing the magazine as you get primary and special weapon kills, and then in the second, as this is primarily for add clear, Chain Reaction turns every kill into a stasis explosion, extending the damage radius and adding chunk damage against beefier enemies nearby. On top, the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them with multiple hits - really fun for PvE.

First-choice PvE roll for sustained damage to Bosses and Majors in end-game content. The reprised Hand in Hand is the only non-endgame arc aggressive shotgun currently (as at v7.0.0.6) in game but, as usual for a world drop, the stats are on the low side - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. Building towards One-Two Punch as your signature perk, Full Choke aids pellet spread, as you'll need to hit your target with all of them. Then Tactical Mag adds an extra extra shot (and a bonuses to reload speed and stability which admittedly, you'll not need so much). As your support perk in the first trait column, Slideshot is normally regarded as a PvP-flavoured perk but bypasses the reload to keep the magazine full for One-Two Punch in the second trait column.

// Irukandji
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): Recommended MW: Handling. Rapid-Fire(140) Stasis Sniper Rifle Special Ammo.  "In PvP you can get a roll identical to Father’s Sins and similar to Praedyth’s Revenge. Father’s Sins does have lower zoom and is craftable for enhanced perks / enhanced intrinsic perk. The good news is that Irukandji is Stasis and Father’s Sins is Void so they won’t compete. In that realm you’re looking at Praedyth’s Revenge which can get adept mods (should you have the adept version). If you have the adept version you can have incredibly high stats, 100 handling and 100 aim assist. Irukandji is great if you don’t have either of those options, but Father’s Sins is craftable and comes from the Witch Queen DLC. Certainly obtainable." |tags:pvp,controller

// Irukandji (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal Rifling), (Steady Rounds, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell), (Envious Assassing, Fourth Time's The Charm, Rapid Hit), (Firing Line, Focused Fury)
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for Major and Boss damage in a fireteam in end-game content. The Season 20 Veist weapon is a rapid-fire sniper rifle with as-expected lowish stats, as a World drop weapon. Irukandji (a small, rare, highly venomous jellyfish from Australia, because of course it would be) does benefit from the Veist Stinger origin trait which is occasionally useful even in its nerfed state. Remember that as at Season 20, this will do less base damage than an equivalent kinetic weapon so, to be competitive, you'll need the parks to fall your way. The main issue you'll find is with keeping the reticule on a boss's crit spot - you'll need to boost Recoil Direction and Stability to make this easier, so Arrowhead Brake or Polygonal Rifling are your barrel perk choices, and Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag or even Steady Rounds (you're not likely to be outside of the damage falloff distance, even with the range penalty) should be your mag perk options. As your first trait column support perk, Envious Assassin overflows your magazine passively with primary and power weapon kills, Fourth Time's The Charm works extends the magazine if you hit crits consistently, or Rapid Hit improves stability (and reload speed) as you fire to keep your reticule steadier. In the signature perk, second column trait, Firing Line is more forgiving of an occasional missed shot when you're in a fireteam but, if you're flying solo, Focused Fury will boost damage in the bottom half of your magazine if you can hit your crits consistently.

// Iterative Loop (PvE first-choice roll)

First-choice PvE roll for Arc synergy and burst damage. Seeing as fusion rifles apply the highest Jolt tick damage of any special weapon, it would be rude not to pick or shape a roll. Rapid fire fusions need a fair bit of control with nine bolts being fired, so Arrowhead Break takes the recoil direction to 77, or up the stability through Fluted Barrel or Polygonal Rifling. In the battery, there's nothing to help speed up reloading, so Particle Repeater adds more stability, or Accelerated Coils speeds up charge time. Compulsive Reloader and a Reload Speed Masterwork boosts reload to 100 at the top half of the mag, so your reloads after a kill to proc Voltshot should be as snappy as it's possible to get. On top, the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them with rapid kills - really fun for PvE.

First-choice PvE roll for Major and Boss damage in end-game content. Shapeable. The Hakke foundry for Season 20 is Marsilion-C (named after the King of Muslim Spain in the late 700s CE, if you're asking), a rapid-fire, solar power grenade launcher with decent stats and which is very usable if you don't already have existing options. For major or boss damage, if you look build into Explosive Light as your signature perk in the second trait column then, as your blast radius is already set to 100, you can concentrate on Velocity in your Barrel - Quick Launch or Smart Drift Control. With 100 Blast Radius, Spike Grenades will be much less effective, so Augmented Drum is the better mag perk, as this synergises with Field Prep as your support perk in the first trait column, for more ammo reserves and faster reloads. The Enhanced Explosive Light perk grants an extra stack of damage over the standard version, so you'll have a magazine capable of using all seven stacks before reloading!

First-choice PvE roll for Major and Boss damage in end-game content. Shapeable. The Hakke foundry for Season 20 is Marsilion-C (named after the King of Muslim Spain in the late 700s CE, if you're asking), a rapid-fire, solar power grenade launcher with decent stats and which is very usable if you don't already have existing options. For major or boss damage, if you look build into Explosive Light as your signature perk in the second trait column then, as your blast radius is already set to 100, you can concentrate on Velocity in your Barrel - Quick Launch or Smart Drift Control and, even with 100 Blast Radius, Spike Grenades will still provide some extra impact damage as your mag perk. Envious Assassin overflows the magazine from primary and special weapon skills so you can take full advantage of the Enhanced Explosive Light's extra stack of damage over the standard version and have a magazine capable of using all seven stacks before reloading! Recommended MW: Velocity, with a damage-boosting (Major, Boss or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod|tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-MajorSpec, BossSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, Controller, M+KB

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. (??? ???): First-choice PvE roll for solar synergy and Minor add-clear in end-game content. Shapeable. The Hakke foundry for Season 20 is Marsilion-C (named after the King of Muslim Spain in the late 700s CE, if you're asking), a rapid-fire, solar power grenade launcher with decent stats and which is very usable if you don't already have existing options. If you looking for a fun add-clear weapon for bulkier minors, with an eye towards Incandescent as your signature perk in the second trait slot, then maximise your Blast Radius with your barrel and mag perks, and masterwork - Volatile Launch or Confined Launch with High-Explosive Ordnance. Envious Assassin overflows the magazine from primary and special weapon kills, or Field Prep adds bonus reserves and reload speed as you options for your support park in the first trait column. Both add utility to Incandescent, and you can add Ember of Ashes for more scorch stacks and faster ignitions.

First-choice PvE roll for damage to Bosses in end-game content. First thing to say about the reprised Nasreddin (named for a legendary trickster figure in Muslin folklore) is that if you already have a decent arc sword, you can give this a miss, as there's nothing that really makes it stand out except, maybe, for a slightly higher base Impact stat, and the new Devrim Kay VIII Foundry origin trait which should make the heavy attack rechage rate a little faster, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. For newer Guardians, the usual recommendations of Jagged Edge as the blade perk for additinal damage, Swordmaster's Guard for the guard perk to get the heavy attack up as fast as possible. Then Relentless Strikes as your support perk in the first trait column, which works well to return ammo against all enemies, and either Whirlwind Blade or Surrounded, to boost damage, for your signature perk in the second.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 (https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for add suppression in end-game activities. Shapeable. This drops into a very competitive field of arc lightweight grenade launchers, although it does have decent stats except for handling. The usual play is to look for velocity, to get the grenade to its target as fast as possible, and handling, for speedy swaps, and it'll be no different this time. Fortunately, the Noble Deeds origin trait helps with Handling (and Reload Speed), so fits in really well. Quick Launch is the best barrel, but Smart Drift Control isn't far behind. For add control, Disorienting Grenades give you breathing space in a firefight. Pair that with Envious Assassin, which can give you up to three in the barrel(!) as your support perk in the first trait column, and Disruption Break, for 50% bonus kinetic damage to burst down chunkier red bar Minors and the occasional Major while they stumble around as the signature perk, and you probably have the perfect add control breach-loading GL.

High Velocity Rounds boosts reload speed as well as velocity. Then Threat Detector or Field Prep as your support perk in the first trait column helps too.

Omolon Fluid Dynamics aside, these have always been one of my favorite classes of sidearms. Being that Senuna SI6 is stasis, the best perk for it is Headstone. Being able to slow and deal AoE damage off of a single kill is extremely strong. We all know how strong Disorienting Grenades are. Slow is just a different version of that. I don’t have to tell you all that. Feeding Frenzy is your best bet if you are “maining” this sidearm, but Envious Assassin could be fun. I don’t love it on primary ammo weapons as you should be using these the most, but depending on your build you could be swapping more than me. Another great perk to look out for is Golden Tricorn. Less useful if you don’t use Stasis, but extremely strong now with our current surge mods." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): Recommended MW: Range. Omolon Adaptive(491) Stasis Sidearm Primary Ammo.  "Senuna SI6 is arguably the best three-burst sidearm. Slickdraw gives you 100 handling. A counterbalance mod gives you 99 recoil direction. You can then invest entirely into range as Omolon Fluid Dynamics will give you your stability. The only issue is the fourth column perk. Headstone is great in 3v3. Elemental Capacitor can bump up your stability on void, or forgo a counterbalance mod on Stasis. If you jump a lot then Strand could be a great option for you. Headseeker is another good option. Ideally I would run Headstone just for locking down that position and having some cover as well. Certainly a gun I will farm for and then throw in my vault to use on random loadout shenanigans." |tags:pvp,controller

// Senuna SI6 (PvE first-choice roll)
// Arrowhead Brake, (Flared Magwell, Appended Mag, Light Mag), Feeding Frenzy, Headstone
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for stasis synergy and Minor add-clear in general content. The Season 20 Omolon weapon (named after Celtic godess worshipped in Roman Britain, if you're asking) is an Adaptive Stasis Sidearm. First thing to say is that, if you already have a decent stasis sidearm, this really doesn't offer anything much new so you can probably give it a miss. For newer Guardians, controlling the recoil on sidearms, through recoil direction and stability, is the job of your barrel and mag although additional reload speed for the Senuna is also useful. If you're a serial reloaded, the Omolon origin trait will help with both in the top half of the magazine.

First-choice PvE roll for stasis synergy and Minor add-clear in general content. The Season 20 Omolon weapon (named after Celtic godess worshipped in Roman Britain, if you're asking) is an Adaptive Stasis Sidearm. First thing to say is that, if you already have a decent stasis sidearm, this really doesn't offer anything much new so you can probably give it a miss. For newer Guardians, controlling the recoil on sidearms, through recoil direction and stability, is the job of your barrel and mag although additional reload speed for the Senuna is also useful.

First-choice PvE roll for burst damage in end-game activities. Sniper rifles are in a bit of a tough spot as v7.0.0.3, but it's worth holding on to a good roll or two in the Vault, just in case. If you're shaping one, Fluted Barrel makes it snappier, and you can bypass the reload speed penalty of Extended Barrel with Backup Mag and Envious Assassin, to overload your magazine of 5 to 8. In the second trait column, Explosive Payload adds a flat 15% bonus damage or, in a fireteam, Firing Line adds 20% crit damage. On top, the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them with multiple hits - really fun for PvE.

If you're having trouble controlling the recoil, Heating Up will help correct the recoil direction on kills, and then match this with your choice of the range of damage output-increasing traits.

[...] Fire and Forget also being stasis allows you to go big damage with Silence and Squall and font of might. The aggressive burst linear fusions are definitely best in slot. Fire and Forget is an incredible gift from the Bungie gods. I would highly recommend bringing the recoil direction up to 100 with arrowhead brake. That way you can solely focus on fighting flinch. You can go a couple different routes with magazine and masterwork, but I prefer mag dumping and better burst dps with accelerated coils and charge time MW. Field prep is best for pure damage, but headstone and vorpal are probably what I will be going for. That way I can have some decent damage and crowd control.

F&F is a non-endgame obtainable  boss-killing replacement for Reed's Regret, and a aggressive-frame companion to Stormchaser.

For boss damage, use Field Prep to boost your ammo reserves (which you'll be calling on with Veist Stinger), and you'll get plenty of opportunity to proc the 20% damage boost from Focused Fury once you hit six individual crits (the trait procs on individual shots rather than on bursts).

// Retrofit Escapade
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I dislike 900 rpm machine guns. They don’t feel very strong for how fast they fire. If I had some good Rambo moments where I could shred hordes of low-tier adds without having to recoil control that much I would love it. But having the lowest base stats across the machine gun archetypes and the fastest rpm makes them unwieldy. Arrowhead brake will bring up the terribly low recoil direction and having more in the magazine means you can be off target for 0.001s and not waste half your ammo. Feeding frenzy and field prep are both ways to bump up the decent reload speed. Golden tricorn will get you the best bang for your glimmer when paired with a void subclass. All void subclasses are viable in end game content so that’s not an issue. Frenzy is best when not on a void subclass and vorpal will allow you to do increased but not substantial damage in and out of combat." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Veles-X
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Veles-X is an aggressive burst pulse rifle that doesn’t need a raid to acquire. [...] If you happen to use void, however, getting golden tricorn 2x should be a cakewalk. The synergy is there to take this gun with echo of instability. Get a kill with Veles-X first, throw a grenade and get volatile rounds. You have golden tricorn 2x, this can stack with font of might for insane damage output. You have volatile rounds for add clear and if you get the kill you’ll have a small overshield to use. This is incredible for almost all activities. Unless you can’t get the grenade kill easily I would keep this in your inventory." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Unfortunately for Prolonged Engagement it won’t see a lot of use outside of PvE. Having 14 zoom makes it firmly middle of the pack and having the lowest base range in its class (technically Escape Velocity is lower, but Escape Velocity also gets sights, not barrels) doesn’t help it. What it lacks in range it does make up for in stability, being on the upper percentile. It also has some of the best aim assist for its archetype. Rangefinder is definitely a must, as is pushing up the range. Hammer-forged rifling or smallbore is going to be key, but don’t decrease other stats just to increase your range."

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Is the current meta open enough to allow Wendigo to flex its tired muscles? I think so. GLs aren’t oppressive in PvP but they offer better in between than a rocket or a machine gun. It can clear rooms quickly and do decent single target damage. With a linear fusion rifle nerf incoming we might see a rise in grenade launcher usage. With Wendigo being at the top of the list. Spike will give you damage, but better utility might be blinding. If you want to go all into damage, spike grenades, golden tricorn, adept big ones, and font of might will give you some incredible damage output. It’s a lot harder to upkeep on a grenade launcher, and especially when you’re dealing with a boss with limited fodder you might not be able to sustain golden tricorn 2x. Even with that set up you will have some great burst damage." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Wendigo is interesting in PvP. I wouldn’t use it, but I also wouldn’t be upset with someone if they did. It has utility and it can work similar to other grenade launchers. Proximity grenades adds forgiveness and flexibility. Impulse amplifier makes it more of a pocket rocket launcher, and rangefinder will just make whatever arc the grenade has minimal. Another good shout is explosive light. If you hold onto your explosive light shots, or build it up without having power ammo, you will have even more flexibility with the added damage, and be able to counter supers with ease."

It has some of the lowest base stats within its archetypes but some of the most unique perks that can put it well above the rest. For one, it is the only rapid-fire frame to roll rangefinder. Putting it in a range class well above its stats. It can also roll Iron Grip for a whopping +20 stability without sacrificing your barrel and magazine perks to stability. The only other auto rifle in this class to compete with Dark Decider would be Krait and given comparable rolls (DD - hammer-forged, accurized, iron grip, rangefinder / K - hammer-forged, ricochet, overflow, moving target) Dark Decider would have 2 whole meters over Krait.

// Cold Front
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Abysmal stability means this thing will kick like a mule and being under the 20 stability threshold means you’ll be taking extra flinch. So the priority with this weapon is to improve stability (and any other stats) as soon as possible. Enter the community-named “musketeer” build (Stats and One for All). With a quick pass over 3 targets, you’ll gain stats boosts and damage. Tac Mag may not be the most stat heavy option, but the extra bullet may help in securing that initial activation. Other stat raising perks can work, but don’t keep any rolls without ‘em.

Option of Omolon Fluid Dynamics or the Dawning Surprise origin trait can help you gain ability energy and restart healing by collecting a small box after killing a half-dozen enemies or so. This is the first Stasis Lightweight frame Pulse Rifle, the frame providing +20 mobility and 6.25% boost to movement. Has decent stats compared to kinetic Lightweights. Sort out the wonky recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake, and then any of the Combat Effect Mags, or Flared Magwell will serve you well. For Stasis subclasses, Thresh boosts your super regen speed and Headstone provides you with a crystal to use.

// Stay Frosty
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Stay Frosty is a Lightweight Pulse Rifle and I couldn’t be happier to have it in the game. Being a Stasis weapon, it has access to Headstone. Which not only is a hilarious perk when clearing mobs but also can help activate various Stasis Fragments that care about proximity or shattering of crystals. Well-Rounded is one of my favorite perks introduced this year, granting a stack of 10 range, stability and handling for using your grenade or scoring a hit with a charged melee. The gameplay loop is super satisfying and encourages integration of gunplay and ability usage. Recommended MW: Reload|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Stay Frosty
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvP / M+KB / Controller): Encore got a rework this season and it works well with Desperado as any missed precision final blows will still increase the range, stability and accuracy of the weapon (5, 8, and 1.25% / stack, up to 4 stacks). With the classic combo of Arrowhead Brake and Ricochet Rounds, Stay Frosty will perform. Another possible fourth column perk would be Headseeker as it also got a rework that increases damage and aim assist. Either way, the lightweight frame will additionally give you a little boost in movement speed which may help you take cover from that Chaos Reach that just showed up.

// Stay Frosty
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Let me address the elephant in the gun, "Thresh". Thresh is not often seen as a top tier perk, but that's because it's typically fighting for 4th slot against damage perks or better utility perks. In this case however, it's a 3rd slot pick which means you can use it in tandem with the better utility perk, "Headstone". Assuming the headstone explosions trigger Thresh in much the same way it does Stats for All and Unrelenting, it should make for some decent super gains for your stasis builds.

With 55 Recoil Direction, Arrowhead Brake is a must on Stay Frosty and High-Caliber should assist in opening duels to get KW/KC rolling.

With auto-loading holster you won’t have to worry about reload speed and you’ll get all the benefits of a bigger magazine with appended mag. Finally there’s target lock. This season’s newest perk. Target lock will increase your damage the longer you stay on target. With backup mag and appended mag you cap out your magazine at 75.

//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): LMGs are without question some of the best mob-clearing weapons in the game. So lean into that with Subsistence and Incandescent. Avalanche takes Arrowhead quite nicely (70 to 100 recoil direction) and Ricochet rounds are my personal go-to for the range and stability bonuses it provides. Give it a try and you’ll see why it is my personal favorite LMG. Recommended MW: Reload|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Avalanche
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvP / M+KB / Controller): Adaptives are my favorite LMG archetype and this extends to use within Crucible. With a requirement of 5 crits to achieve the coveted .53s TTK, accuracy is going to be vital: enter DSR + Tap the Trigger. With DSR taking 0.6 seconds to fully ramp up, you will likely be near maximum benefit by that 5th shot. Like Hammerhead and other 450 rpm LMGs after it, this can catch many a Guardian by surprise and melt them quickly! Recommended MW: Range|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Avalanche
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): When my team calls for DPS, my choice is seldom the LMG. So for me, I'm shooting for mass mobbing potential and rocking this weapon with a double special setup. Similar thought process to Glacioclasm, kill stuff with big explosions (or in this case, Scorch) and refill the mag automatically. All reserves, no reload, but Flared Magwell just in case you get hit with a heaping spoonful of "Destiny" and things don't go to plan. Plus, the extra stability is nice.

// Avalanche
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvP / Controller): As a 450, Avalanche falls into a very controllable category in PvP which means you can fairly comfortably commit to more range for short bursts of damage (like the time it might take to drop a guardian) instead of long term consistent shots. So, range range range. A little extra stability for the controller players and once you get a kill and trigger Encore, all subsequent kills should be a lot easier to manage. DSR is also an option, but only if going for multi-kills, in my opinion. If the kills are a little more spread out, I'd rather have Encore. Recommended MW: Range|tags:pvp,controller

//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Cold Steel is what sets this blade apert from every other, the slow-into-freeze ability is an amazing pairing with Stasis subclasses as well as good utility for mods and effects that care about Stasis/Slow application.

// Zephyr
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvP / M+KB / Controller): Okay, hear me out on this combo. It’s a unique one to the Adaptive frame sword archetype and what it allows is the ability to steal the overshield of a supering Guardian and apply it to yourself while dealing increased damage. This could mean you can easily shut down roaming, ground-based supers and survive the opposing team’s retribution. Otherwise, it’s just like any other sword in the Crucible (that doesn’t have Eager Edge). Recommended MW: Impact|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Zephyr
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): This one is tricky. I wanted to look for Thresh and Chain Reaction, but Half Truths can get that same roll and it would be enhanced via crafting. So it's necessary to commit to the thing only this sword can do, and that's Cold Steel. I figured Cold Steel and Wellspring would be a nice combo for any hyper aggressive Stasis builds. Recommended MW: Impact|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Zephyr
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB / Controller): I got nothing. I personally would never take this sword into PvP, but if I absolutely had to I'd likely end up using my heavy to fight supers, which would never result in me escaping unscathed so unrelenting might help? Maybe? In any case, Cold Steel is doing nothing for you in PvP, which is the only thing that makes this sword unique. Recommended MW: Impact|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

Unfortunately, stats are pretty weak across the board - the 50 Recoil Direction and joint lowest zoom means that, even with a recoil direction-correcting or stability barrel, you'll will still probably find a Counterbalance mod necessary. You really need both more range and more stability, once you've sorted the recoil direction, so Ricochet Rounds are your best mag perk. In the first trait column, Rangefinder will help push out range with an extra point of zoom. The second trait column is a bit short on PvP picks, but Golden Tricorn is the most reliable damage perk. One stack after a kill drops TTK down to 0.73s (7c, 1b) and accuracy-adjusted TTK to 0.8s (5c, 4b). If you manage to proc both stacks, this drops further to a lightning-fast TTK of 0.47s (6c) or an accuracy-adjusted TTK of 0.67s (4c, 3b).

While it is great to cross compare weapons like that, all it does is allow for loadout diversity. Neither is “superior” because realistically you will not be making the choice of Fatebringer vs Zaouli's Bane, you will have your special weapon combination as well to consider. Want to use Izanagi's Burden or Arbalest? cannot use Fatebringer, the choice has been made for you.

From the hugely popular Fatebringer to the fan favorite Dire Promise, from the OG Eyasluna to OG Austringer. Not even including the exotic kinetic hand cannons, DFA has a high hill to climb. The benefit DFA has over some of the other weapons is the possibility of getting adept rolls for the bonus masterworks and adept mods. This doesn’t entirely cover the fact that DFA’s perk pool just shipped underwhelming. Outlaw and rampage are tried and true but extremely boring. Vorpal weapon is great and makes DFA the first kinetic 140 with vorpal, but that alone doesn’t bring it up past some of the aforementioned powerhouses."

// Yesteryear
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Yesteryear is a fun addition to the 390 archetype. I am slightly disappointed you need arrowhead brake to make this weapon feel good. Coupled with a counterbalance mod and you hit the sweet spot of 95. Outlaw makes a return as the best reload perk. Which is unfortunate seeing as rapid hit is objectively better. Subsistence is another great option but loses value in higher end content. Focused fury paired with rapid hit would be an incredible combo on a primary, if Yesteryear would have gotten that combo it would be the only pulse rifle in the game with those two perks at the same time. Ambitious assassin with multikill clip is an extremely fun combination of increasing the magazine as well as increasing your damage at the same time.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Yesteryear
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP Controller): Recommended MW: Stability “PvP is a slightly different story. You still want arrowhead brake and counterbalance to make this weapon feel smooth. Ricochet rounds are going to give you the best flinch resistance and stats. Perpetual motion will bring up the remaining stats the rest of the way, and rampage will allow you to two burst after a kill. If you want more of a dueling pulse you can opt for eye of the storm. Desperado makes an appearance on a different frame, but I do not see that as being the best choice for a lot of players as it makes the gun feel like two different weapons before or after a kill.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo)|tags:PvP, Controller

// Tears of Contrition
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Precision frame scouts do not have a strong presence in PvP. To give you the best chance using one, use arrowhead brake. That will clean up the recoil enough. There aren’t many lanes that require 80m+ of range, so going for steady rounds will make each shot easier to land. No distractions also combats a lot of the flinch scouts naturally take. Explosive payload increases your outgoing flinch. All of these steps should give you the best chance in the Crucible." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Blood Feud looks to be the best weapon from Plunder activities. Being a stasis 750 with arguably better roll combinations over Cold Front from the Dawning. Wait just a second, Cold Front was not even Stasis. In PvE I think the absolute best combo is going to be ambitious assassin with headstone. Headstone kills do proc ambitious assassin for you to overload your magazine. It can be a little finicky but it does work. If you would prefer non-Stasis oriented builds and a more neutral weapon you can go for the most punchy weapon this side of Titan (RIP Sloane). Grave robber or pugilist with swashbuckler is the play. Just make sure to have some stability so you will not be looking at Io (RIP Asher).“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Stasis Submachine Gun Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "it shipped super underwhelming. DFA has a lot of competition in its slot. From the hugely popular Fatebringer to the fan favorite Dire Promise, from the OG Eyasluna to OG Austringer. Not even including the exotic kinetic hand cannons, DFA has a high hill to climb. The benefit DFA has over some of the other weapons is the possibility of getting adept rolls for the bonus masterworks and adept mods. This doesn’t entirely cover the fact that DFA’s perk pool just shipped underwhelming. Outlaw and rampage are tried and true but extremely boring. Vorpal weapon is great and makes DFA the first kinetic 140 with vorpal, but that alone doesn’t bring it up past some of the aforementioned powerhouses."

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "For PvP you’re just better off using any other hand cannon. Fragile focus adds a good 2-3m of range without taking damage, but is unrealistic to keep up in 6s. In 3s it can be obtainable but is also hard to keep up once you start shooting. Perpetual motion is the best for adding stability and handling, two stats DFA does need. Opening shot coupled with fragile focus could make for some deep clean ups but the fall off of both will be very harsh." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

// Strident Whistle
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Precision frames are some of the better choices for bows in PvP. Strident Whistle would need to have the lowest charge time of 576 to even compete in PvP. Fiberglass arrow shaft brings the accuracy back up after elastic string lowers it. Archer’s tempo is still great here, as is explosive head for double flinch. Moving target is a great pick if you feel you use your bow for follow up shots instead of bow-swap. Successful warm-up paired with archer’s tempo is incredible for some really fast draw times, but it feels almost “kill clip-esque” with successful warm-up needing a kill to activate."

// Out of Bounds
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “The newest crucible weapon is only the slightest bit a disappointment for me. it is an Omolon 900 without phase mag. If you were not around in d2y1 or missed getting a good Stochastic Variable in Season of the Splicer, phase mag is a special Omolon magazine that drops the rpm from 900 (lightweight) to 600 (precision), and increases the damage profile to match the precision frames. The smg keeps its other stats, and retains the lightweight profile, but just hits like a precision frame. Not having that on an Omolon smg just feels wrong. Especially when it is not going to be better than regular lightweights or precision frame smgs. I digress. In most activities you will either have on Funnelweb or CALUS-Mini Tool. Out of Bounds acts as an arc alternative. With how good some arc 3.0 ability cycling is, you can almost guarantee two stacks of golden tricorn. Paired with subsistence to really tear down hordes of enemies. Out of Bounds is not going to be the best, and getting one is going to take some time.

You probably won’t see golden tricorn 2x too often, but when you do and the stars align you’ll have a monster in your hands." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

// Qullim's Terminus (Harrowed)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “I get why Bungie had to change Qullim's Terminus from a 450 to a 360, that would make 3 raids that have 450 machine guns. But Bungie also knows that you cannot craft a Commemoration or Corrective Measure. So I feel like it should have been a 450. Nevertheless it is here as a 360 and we have to like it. Arrowhead will max out the recoil direction, and firing line will give you that big damage. I do not feel comfortable recommending use of a 360 in a raid or dungeon for maximum damage, but in a strike I could see it being a solid option.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Stasis Machine Gun Heavy Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// (Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling), (Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Appended Mag), Triple Tap, Adaptive Munitions
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 22. PvE first-choice roll for end-game add clear and champions. You probably won't get much use out of the Suros origin trait in PvE, but this is a surprisingly competitive choice for the energy slot as at season 17. Improve Handling and Stability with your barrel and mag. Triple Tap extends your mag, and Adaptive Munitions is great for forcing shields (particularly when there's an Acute Solar Burn modifier), and piercing barrier champions when there's an anti-champion mod in the season. Recommended MW: Stability, Handling or Reload Speed, with a Backup Mag or damage-boosting (Minor, Major or Taken Spec) mod.|tags: pve, pve-god, pve-endgame, pve-minor, pve-champion, controller

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 280 with @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Shapeable. Just great stats across the board, plus the unique hipfire boost from the frame make the Battler a top choice for PvP. You're always likely to be taking damage, so the Hot Swap origin perk will be useful too. Out-of-the-box, this has the same TTK as a lightweight - 0.87s with 7 crits and 1 body, or an accuracy-adjusted TTK in 0.93s (6c, 3b), as at v6.2.5. It does have wonky recoil, which Arrowhead Brake sorts out completely, but extra stability plus the 20 Zoom also makes it controllable. Ricochet Rounds, is the reliable mag perk of choice. Then, for duelling, Perpetual Motion boosts your gunfeel stats and Eye of the Storm makes crits easier to hit in a firefight.

// BxR-55 Battler (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), Ricochet Rounds, (Killing Wind, Perpetual Motion), Incandescent
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 280 with @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining, particularly for solar subclasses. Shapeable. Just great stats across the board, plus the unique hipfire boost from the frame make the Battler a top choice for PvP. You're always likely to be taking damage, so the Hot Swap origin perk will be useful too. Out-of-the-box, this has the same TTK as a lightweight - 0.87s with 7 crits and 1 body, or an accuracy-adjusted TTK in 0.93s (6c, 3b), as at v6.2.5. It does have wonky recoil, which Arrowhead Brake sorts out completely, but extra stability plus the 20 Zoom also makes it controllable. Ricochet Rounds, is the reliable mag perk of choice. For kill-chaining, Killing Wind or Perpetual Motion all provide boosts so that you can take advantage of the scorch spread by an ignition kill. Recommended MW: Handling or Range, with a Freehand Grip, Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-KillChain, PvP-God, MKB, Controller

Firmly Planted increases accuracy and handling when crouched and activates on a slide. You do not have to stay crouched for it to be activated and could even crouch mid-gunfight for all the bonuses."

// Posterity (PvE first-choice roll)
// Fluted Barrel, Tactical Mag, Voltshot, Frenzy
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast Versus Enemies episode 48 with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for arc synergy and end-game content. The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits (the amount depends on the weapon archetype). Who would have thought that the hottest property from DSC would be a precision hand cannon? Stats are good by comparison with competitors. Fluted Barrel makes it feel snappier and Tactical Mag adds couple of extra bullets and stability. Unusually, Voltshot rolls in the first trait column and is the runaway best option for add clear, and using Frenzy as a second damage perk also boosts handling and reload to 100 so you can proc Voltshot's jolt as fast as possible after a kill, which will also stun Overload champions from Lightfall (Season 20) onwards. Just chef's kiss good. Recommended MW: Range, with a Minor or Taken Spec mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-Champion, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, Controller, M+KB

The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits (the amount depends on the weapon archetype). Good stats by comparison with other rapid-fire scouts, and there are a couple of ways to go with your roll. The first thing to do is sort out the recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake, which also helps handling a bit. Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell add stability and reload speed (and an extra bullet for Tac Mag). Rapid Hit or Perpetual Motion layers more stability and reload speed - stability is good to help stay on a crit spot. Incandescent is great for add clear and hits your solar verbs.

// Midha's Reckoning (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Hammer-Forged Rifling, Extended Barrel, Full Bore), (Projection Fuse, Accelerated Coils), Backup Plan, Successful Warm-Up
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 277 with @illPhysics (and thanks to @Legoleflash). First-choice PvP pick - one of those rare weapons that works for both duelling and kill-chaining. Shapeable. Definitely not meta out of the box as at v6.2.0.7 with a base TTK of 1.09s with four bolts, but there's a perk combination that helps with that. Most stats are okayish, with Aim Assistance a standout highest in class - add in some targeting mods on the weapon and helmet if you want to build into this weapon. You're only firing five bolts, so you can spec into range with your barrel, as controlling the recoil should be easier. With the battery perk, you might be tempted by Accelerated Coils for an even faster charge time, but you'll probably get more use from Projection Fuse's extra range for consistency. The real fun is in the two trait columns - Backup Plan gets you to 100 Handling on swapping, and brings the TTK for your first shot down to 0.81s. After your first kill, Successful Warm-Up kicks into reduce it still further to 0.73s. You still need to hit 4 out of 5 bolts, but the targeting mods make that much easier to achieve, and the TTK is faster than an out-of-the-box Rapid Fire Fusion Rifle.

// Midha's Reckoning (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake), (Ionised Battery, Enhanced Battery), Field Prep, Reservoir Burst
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Shapeable. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Decent in-slot stats compared to Exile's Curse or Wizened Rebuke. Generally, with fewer bolts being fired from a High-Impact frame, you don't have to worry so much about stability, so can either push the range or improve handling with your barrel. Increasing the battery size with Ionised Battery and Reservoir Burst pushes you to the maximum of 8 in the mag (with Enhanced RB you only need Enhanced Battery). You can get around the reload penalty from Ionised Battery when crouching with Field Prep (and have more ammo in reserve) to use in combination with Reservoir Burst. With a battery size of eight, you'll get up to five overflowed shots with the origin trait if you're in a Raid near a full fireteam, or three reloading in a normal fireteam of three. RB procs on any overflowed charges from the origin trait, with a 25% damage bonus and those lovely explosions on kills (maybe with Arc 3.0 Spark of Beacons for a bit of blinding too) on them all.

// Midha's Reckoning (Harrowed) (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Hammer-Forged Rifling, Extended Barrel, Full Bore), (Projection Fuse, Accelerated Coils), Backup Plan, Successful Warm-Up
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 277 with @illPhysics (and thanks to @Legoleflash). First-choice PvP pick - one of those rare weapons that works for both duelling and kill-chaining. Shapeable. Definitely not meta out of the box as at v6.2.0.7 with a base TTK of 1.09s with four bolts, but there's a perk combination that helps with that. Most stats are okayish, with Aim Assistance a standout highest in class - add in some targeting mods on the weapon and helmet if you want to build into this weapon. You're only firing five bolts, so you can spec into range with your barrel, as controlling the recoil should be easier. With the battery perk, you might be tempted by Accelerated Coils for an even faster charge time, but you'll probably get more use from Projection Fuse's extra range for consistency. The real fun is in the two trait columns - Backup Plan gets you to 100 Handling on swapping, and brings the TTK for your first shot down to 0.81s. After your first kill, Successful Warm-Up kicks into reduce it still further to 0.73s. You still need to hit 4 out of 5 bolts, but the targeting mods make that much easier to achieve, and the TTK is faster than an out-of-the-box Rapid Fire Fusion Rifle.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP Controller): Recommended MW: Handling “In PvP you can make arguments for and against the return of Mindbender's Ambition. On one hand it is still a strong aggressive frame shotgun that can get adept mods. On the other hand so is the Timelost Found Verdict and VoG is less of a challenge. Master VoG will still kick an unprepared ass, but will not be nearly as difficult as it used to be. To make Mindbender's Ambition work in the crucible you will have to invest into range and handling. Threat detector will take up a decent chunk of handling by speeding up the ready animation. But barrel shroud an a handling masterwork paired with quick charge will get you the rest of the way to where you want to be.

With both Crimil's Dagger and Steady Hand being removed from the Iron Banner loot pool there really is only Loud Lullaby in the kinetic slot. Pure Poetry is not the best option, but it is nice to have it. The best benefit over Loud Lullaby is when you get a few resets in for your vanguard rep and have multiple perks within each column. For PvE outlaw is going to be your best friend. It can allow you to completely ignore reload and invest into handling or stability for your preference. Another great option is the newly buffed ambitious assassin to also circumvent the low mag / low reload speed. In the fourth column you cannot go wrong with any number of damage perks. Frenzy, rampage, harmony, focused fury, multikill clip, or the new pugilist.

The main draw for Hung Jury as at v6.2.0.6 is Box Breathing in the second trait column, which means you can three tap any resilience (2 Crit + 1 Body of a 0.67s TTK) and two tap tap lower resiliences, as at Season 18 v6.2.0.6. To proc it though, you need to almost treat the weapon like it needs pre-charging by ADS-ing before an ancounter, It goes without saying, you need to land crits and stay mobile. You don't need extra range, so focus on Handling and stability with your barrel and mag. Rapid Hit helps further with Stability (as well as a Reload Speed boost), Moving Target adds a little extra crit stickiness or Surplus adds gunfeel boosts, as long as you hang on to your abilities. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Full Auto Retrofit mod, Radar Tuner (to help you stay aware of your surroundings if hardscoping), Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-Duelling, MKB, Controller

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with @DefyFly. First choice PvP roll for kill-chaining. Drops from Gambit, so reset your reputation as many times as you have patience for first, to maximise the trait options from decrypting engrams. You don't need extra range,  and the high base zoom (26) means you can control the recoil with Stability, and not worry about Recoil Direction, in your barrel and mag. Kill Clip, in the second trait column, reduces the TTK to a competitive 0.7s (3 crits, 1 body), as at Season 18 v6.2.0.6, and you can pair this with Tunnel Vision or Rapid Hit, both of which will work well.

Top it off with ricochet rounds, garnish it with a range masterwork. Cook it on high with your favorite shader. Boom bam, pizza cutter-22. you are welcome“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Solar Submachine Gun Primary Ammo)|tags:PvP, Controller

// Allied Demand
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Allied Demand is a great weapon to see come back. I love the 300 rpm adaptive frame sidearms. Something about them just feels best. Not quite the bullet hoses of the 450s, a little less fatiguing on the finger than the 360s, and feel better than the 260s for me. In PvE I really would not take a sidearm into any serious activities. They just do not have the damage or the range you would want to make them feel as effective. To make this sidearm feel as good as possible I would recommend bumping up the handling and stability. Sure you will not be able to shoot as far, but you are using a sidearm. Be real here. Frenzy is great for getting that quick damage and reload. With such a small mag another great shout is multikill clip to keep damage stacks after each kill.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Allied Demand
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP Controller): Recommended MW: Stability “In PvP you can go one or two ways max range, or not quite max range. With rangefinder in the third column you can really opt for anything within that final column and be okay. Eye of the storm is a perfect pairing because you will definitely be taking damage to get into sidearm range to begin with. Multikill clip gives you that slaying potential. If you wanted to invest fully into range you can do so and you will hit 18.95m, but I would suggest going to hammer-forged, losing that extra meter and dropping to 17.96 so you will not lose any stats. 18.95 m (max), 17.96 without losing stats“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo)|tags:PvP, Controller

// Horror's Least
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "For PvP the best perk to look for is kill clip. Absolutely no competition. This takes the crit damage from 24 (72 per burst) to 31.92 (95.76 per burst) which gives you an incredibly easy three burst kill. Either way you’ll need all three bursts to kill but anything to make kills easier is a bonus. The 540 RPM makes firing at the full RPM incredibly difficult without the full auto retrofit. The issue is that even with arrowhead brake you’ll still want to slot a counterbalance mod to take the recoil direction to 100, which means manually pulling that trigger at 540 RPM."

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "With triple tap, fourth time’s the charm, and actium war rig, you could fire forever. In most cases that is entirely a meme, but against specific bosses it could be useful to have. A more utilitarian roll would be triple tap with vorpal weapon to slot in adept big ones when the grandmaster nightfalls release. Ideally you want to bring up the recoil direction from the base 60, but chambered compensator or extended barrel won’t do as much, and you won’t want to slot a counterbalance mod in favor of any of the spec mods. Arrowhead then becomes the only choice to really improve that recoil to something more desirable. Other options are then just to make the gun feel better. Stats for all pairs really well with one for all, but also fourth time’s the charm or vorpal for a better feeling gun. And perpetual motion will elevate the gun feel without needing to shoot.".

Forgiveness has two reload bypassing perks in subsistence and demolitionist. Vorpal and grenade focus are great and fall into different use cases.

With a base air accuracy stat of 25, Adept Icarus adding +15, and Air Assault giving up to 60 as your health drops, you could have 100 air accuracy with rapid hit, ricochet rounds and a 17m effective range.

// Tyranny of Heaven (PvE first-choice roll)
// Elastic String, Compact Arrow Shaft, Archer's Tempo, Explosive Head
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 23. PvE first choice roll for endgame content. Although suffering by comparison with the Precision bow subtype, if you've got a good roll, it's maybe worth hanging onto in case they ever get a bit of love.

// Crisis Inverted
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "While Crisis Inverted doesn’t have the furthest range even with rangefinder it does have the best ease of use of almost any non-180 hand cannon. Omolon fluid dynamics adds a whopping +20 stability at the top half of the magazine. This puts you right into that 65-75 range of having the best return on your stability and that’s just for choosing the omolon trait over the crucible one. Meaning as long as you’re diligent in reloading you can keep that buff for every single engagement. You can then invest into range or handling to make the weapon feel perfectly yours. Another sleeper combo on the sleeper weapon would be moving target and elemental capacitor on stasis for all the zoom. Not like eager edge zoom, more like MIDA zoom.".

// Cataclysmic (Adept)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "For PvP linear fusions can be hit or miss (zing), they require either set up for OHK, or to lower the charge time to treat it more like a sniper. Cataclysm can get the latter to a very strong degree. Accelerated coils, charge time MW, and successful warm up will net you such a fast charge time. And with linear fusion rifles being one shot kills to the head you can have a linear that is basically a sniper rifle after that first kill. You know what? Just use a sniper rifle.".

// Syncopation-53
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "If one pulse screamed consistency this pulse would do it. PvP falls into one of two categories. Consistency or lethality. Syncopation doesn’t have anything to push it into the 2 burst realm outside of person buffs (empowering rift, inertia override, etc) but it does have utter consistency. Arrowhead cleans up the recoil perfectly, while high-caliber rounds makes it harder to get hit in return. Then the choice between moving target, the newly buffed hip-fire grip in combination with headseeker or rangefinder." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

// False Promises
//notes: (PvP / Controller): Mercules904 (pretty good PvP/controller) - "What a great gun! I've been waiting for a Legendary High-Impact AR that felt like SUROS Regime with Dual Speed Receiver, and I think we've finally found one. Stat-wise it suffers from most of the same drawbacks that the other high impacts do, poor stability, low aim assist and handling, but for some reason the return to center speed of the reticle is much faster than I'm used to on the others guns in the archetype (like Halfdan) and so the low stability doesn't seem to have much of an effect of the usability of the weapon."|tags:pvp,controller
